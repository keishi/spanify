# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1227

## First error
Overlapping replacements: ./net/base/ip_address.h at offset 2053, length 8: "" and offset 2055, length 0: "*"

## Category
Overlapping replacements between EraseMemberCall and EraseMemberCall.

## Reason
The rewriter attempts to add `.data()` to the `begin()` method in `net/base/ip_address.h`. However, it also attempts to spanify the return type of `begin()`. The overlapping replacements are likely due to an attempt to insert `.data()` while also modifying the return type, creating conflicting edits.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid spanifying the return type of the `begin()` method or avoid adding `.data()` to the return type if it requires spanifying the return type.

## Note
The overlapping replacement error occurs when the rewriter tries to modify the return type of `begin()` to `base::span<uint8_t>` and simultaneously insert `.data()` in the same location. This suggests a conflict in the rewriter's logic for handling return types and adding `.data()`.
