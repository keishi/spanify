## First error

../../storage/common/file_system/file_system_util.cc:33:24: error: redefinition of 'kExternalDir' with a different type: 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') vs 'const char[]'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying const char[] variable used as extern variable.

## Reason
The rewriter is spanifying `const char[]` variables, but in this case the variable `kExternalDir` is declared as an extern variable in a header file with type `const char[]`. The rewriter is generating code to re-define the variable with a different type `const std::string_view` in the source file. This is not valid C++.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid spanifying `const char[]` variables that are declared as extern variables.

## Note
The second error is "no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'const char[]' to 'base::span<const char>'". This error is caused by the first error.
The third error is "no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'". This error is caused by the spanification.
