# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1016

## First error

../../ui/snapshot/snapshot_aura_unittest.cc:81:24: error: no viable conversion from 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<uint32_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned int>')

## Category
Rewriter failed to handle raw pointer passed to span.

## Reason
The code changes attempt to convert a raw `uint32_t*` to a `base::span<uint32_t>`. The compiler flags this as an error because there's no implicit conversion from a raw pointer to a span. The rewriter didn't insert the necessary information about the size of the buffer.

## Solution
The rewriter should either:
1. Replace the raw pointer with a `base::span` during the conversion, or
2. Wrap the raw pointer in a `base::span` using the size of the buffer, if available.

In this specific case, we can't determine the size of the buffer that `bitmap->pixelRef()->pixels()` is pointing to.
