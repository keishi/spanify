# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_15_patch_1451

## First error

../../components/password_manager/core/browser/ui/passwords_grouper.cc:61:54: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union

## Category
Rewriter needs to add .data() to arrayified `char[]` variable used with std::string.

## Reason
The code attempts to use `.subspan()` on the result of `.data()` called on a `std::array<char, N>`.  However, `.data()` on `std::array` returns a `char*`, and `.subspan()` is not a valid member function on raw pointers. The rewriter incorrectly assumes the result of kFallbackIconQueryParams.data() is a span. The rewriter should add `.data()` after calling `.subspan()` instead, so it passes the resulting C-style string pointer to the std::string constructor.

## Solution
The rewriter should generate code to add `.data()` after `.subspan()` when that variable is used with std::string as is done in the failing line.
Here is what the code should look like:
```c++
std::string query = kFallbackIconQueryParams.subspan().data()(
       base::EscapeQueryParamValue(credential.GetURL().possibly_invalid_spec(),
                                   /*use_plus=*/false));
```
