# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_15_patch_1054

## First error

../../chrome/browser/process_singleton_posix.cc:693:24: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('std::array<char, kMaxMessageLength>' and 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned long'))

## Category
Rewriter needs to account for arithmetic operations between `std::array` and `size_t`.

## Reason
The code attempts to perform pointer arithmetic on a `std::array` using a `size_t` offset. However, `std::array` does not directly support pointer arithmetic in the same way as raw C-style arrays.

The error occurs in the `read` function call, specifically in the second argument `buf_ + bytes_read_`. The `buf_` is now a `std::array`, which doesn't allow direct pointer arithmetic like adding an integer offset to get a new pointer.

## Solution
The rewriter must transform the expression `buf_ + bytes_read_` to use the `.data()` method to obtain a raw pointer to the underlying array data and then perform the pointer arithmetic.

The corrected code should be:

```c++
read(fd_, buf_.data() + bytes_read_,
             (buf_.size() * sizeof(decltype(buf_)::value_type)) - bytes_read_);
```

The rewriter should be updated to recognize this pattern and insert the `.data()` call when performing arithmetic on `std::array` variables.

## Note
The same error occurs on line 693. The category, reason and solution apply to that error as well.
