# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1103

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/transforms/transform_operations_test.cc:180:26: error: no matching function for call to 'to_array'

      |                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to handle arrayified `char[]` variable used with std::string.

## Reason
The code attempts to use `std::to_array` with an initializer list, but there is no implicit conversion from the initializer list to `std::array`. The compiler cannot deduce the type of the array.

## Solution
The rewriter does not correctly rewrite the initialization. This is likely due to the rewriter not recognizing the pattern.

## Note
The code in question is part of a test. The rewriter shouldn't be rewriting any code in the test directory.
