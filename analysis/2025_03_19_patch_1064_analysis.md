# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1064

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:707:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>' (aka 'span<policy::TestProvider>')

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The rewriter failed to correctly transform the loop initialization to use `base::span`. The line `for (base::span<policy::TestProvider> it = std::begin(kInvalidUrlTestProviders);` attempts to initialize `it` with the result of `std::begin(kInvalidUrlTestProviders)`.  Since `kInvalidUrlTestProviders` is a C-style array, `std::begin` returns a raw pointer (`policy::TestProvider*`).  The rewriter didn't generate the code to construct the `base::span` from the raw pointer. Also the code also tried to increment the span using `++it`, but span is not incrementable.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be able to handle `std::begin` called on C-style arrays when initializing a span. The rewriter needs to rewrite this to construct a `span` and rewrite the iterator.

```c++
  for (base::span<policy::TestProvider> it(kInvalidUrlTestProviders, std::size(kInvalidUrlTestProviders));
       !it.empty(); it = it.subspan(1)) {
    policy_value.Append(GenerateSiteSearchPolicyEntry(it[0]));
  }
```

## Note
The second error regarding the increment is a follow-on from the first.
