# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_373

## First error

../../components/reporting/storage/storage_unittest.cc:993:31: error: expected expression
  993 |                .subspan(sizeof)
      |                               ^

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The replacements for ".data()" and ".subspan()" are conflicting and placed in the wrong place. The original code used memcpy like this:

```c++
memcpy(value_to_sign + sizeof(Encryptor::PublicKeyId), public_value, kKeySize);
```

The rewriter replaced this with the following, but the replacements are in incorrect order:

```c++
memcpy(base::span<uint8_t>(value_to_sign)
               .subspan(sizeof)
               .data()(Encryptor::PublicKeyId),
           public_value, kKeySize);
```

## Solution
The rewriter should correctly generate the following code:

```c++
memcpy(value_to_sign.data() + sizeof(Encryptor::PublicKeyId),
           public_value, kKeySize);
```

## Note
This looks like a conflict between how the rewriter handles `.data()` and `.subspan()` replacements.
