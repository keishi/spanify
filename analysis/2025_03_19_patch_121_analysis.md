## First error

../../chrome/app/chrome_main_linux.cc:56:3: error: no matching function for call to 'AppendExtraArgsFromEnvVar'

## Category
Rewriter needs to add .data() to arrayified `char[]` variable used with std::string.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `constexpr char kExtraFlagsVarName[]` to `constexpr std::array<char, 19> kExtraFlagsVarName`.  On line 56 and line 60, this variable is being passed into a function `AppendExtraArgsFromEnvVar` that is expecting a `std::string` or `const char*`, not a `std::array`. The rewriter should have added `.data()` to the variable.

## Solution
When converting a `char[]` to `std::array`, the rewriter should check if the variable is used with a function that expects `std::string` or `const char*` and add `.data()` to it.

## Note
The other error is: `../../chrome/app/chrome_main_linux.cc:60:56: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union`.  This is because `.data()` was already added, and the rewriter attempted to call `.subspan()` on a pointer type. The category is the same as above.
