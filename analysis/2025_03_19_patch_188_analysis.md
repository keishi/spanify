## First error

../../remoting/host/linux/remoting_user_session.cc:311:10: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'std::array<char, 4096>' to 'base::FilePath'

## Category
Rewriter needs to handle conversion from `std::array<char, SIZE>` to `base::FilePath`.

## Reason
The code attempts to construct a `base::FilePath` object using the `gExecutablePath` variable, which has been converted to `std::array<char, PATH_MAX>`. The `base::FilePath` constructor does not directly accept a `std::array<char, SIZE>`, resulting in the "no matching conversion" error. The rewriter did not insert `.data()` in this case.

## Solution
The rewriter should ensure that when a `std::array<char, SIZE>` variable is used where a C-style string or `const char*` is expected, the `.data()` method is appended to the variable name to obtain a pointer to the underlying character array.

## Note
Other errors in the log indicate similar issues where the `.data()` method is missing after converting `gExecutablePath` to `std::array<char, PATH_MAX>`. Additionally, the usage of `gExecutablePath` in `std::vector<const char*> arg_ptrs = {gExecutablePath, ...}` also needs to be handled in a similar fashion. Also the `-Wformat` error should be fixed by this change.
