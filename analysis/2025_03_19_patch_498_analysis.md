# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_498

## First error

../../base/containers/span.h:946:33: error: cannot form a reference to 'void'
  946 |   using reference = element_type&;
      |                                 ^
../../sandbox/linux/tests/test_utils.cc:52:29: note: in instantiation of template class 'base::span<void>' requested here
   52 | base::span<void> TestUtils::MapPagesOrDie(size_t num_pages) {
      |                             ^

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying `void*`.

## Reason
The rewriter attempted to replace `void*` with `base::span<void>`. This is invalid because `base::span<T>` requires `T` to be a complete type, and `void` is an incomplete type. The error message "cannot form a reference to 'void'" arises from the `reference = element_type&` member within the span template.

## Solution
The rewriter should check if the type is `void` before attempting to spanify a pointer. If the type is `void`, the rewriter should not apply any changes.

## Note
The build failure also includes an error where the code is trying to perform pointer arithmetic on a `base::span`. Need to investigate and fix it separately.
