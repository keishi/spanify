# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1018

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:523:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>' (aka 'span<const policy::TestProvider>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to rewrite iterator loops to work with arrayified variables.

## Reason
The code attempts to initialize a `base::span` with a raw pointer, which is not a valid conversion. The rewriter likely changed the type of `kShortcutNotUniqueTestProviders` to `std::array` but didn't rewrite the loop correctly. The expression `std::begin(kShortcutNotUniqueTestProviders)` returns a raw pointer of type `policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider*`. The for loop needs to iterate using an index instead of iterators.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to rewrite the iterator based for loop to an indexed for loop. Here is the suggested code:

```c++
  const size_t kShortcutNotUniqueTestProvidersSize = std::size(kShortcutNotUniqueTestProviders);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < kShortcutNotUniqueTestProvidersSize; ++i) {
    policy_value.Append(GenerateSiteSearchPolicyEntry(kShortcutNotUniqueTestProviders[i]));
  }
```

## Note
There are additional errors caused by the initial error. The rewriter failed to correctly rewrite the entire statement which resulted in the additional error.
