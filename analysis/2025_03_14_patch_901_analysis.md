# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_901

## First error

../../media/midi/midi_message_queue.cc:32:10: error: no matching member function for call to 'insert'
   32 |   queue_.insert(queue_.end(), data, data.subspan(length));
      |   ~~~~~~~^~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The error occurs because the code attempts to use `base::span` directly as iterators in `circular_deque::insert`. The `circular_deque::insert` function expects iterators that satisfy `forward_iterator` concept. However, `base::span` is not designed to be used as a standard iterator. This is because  `base::span` may not provide all the required operations to be a valid forward iterator.

The fix requires changing the code that calls the affected function. However, the `circular_deque` is third party code which is excluded. So the function `MidiMessageQueue::Add` should not be spanified.

## Solution
Do not spanify the function `MidiMessageQueue::Add` to avoid needing to spanify `base::circular_deque`.

## Note

The patch spanifies the `ReceiveMidiData` functions in `MidiHost` and `MidiManager` but the compiler error happens in `MidiMessageQueue::Add`.
