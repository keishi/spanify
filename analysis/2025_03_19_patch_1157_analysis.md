## First error

../../chrome/browser/apps/icon_standardizer.cc:66:13: error: initializer list cannot be used on the right hand side of operator ':'
   66 |             : {};
      |             ^ ~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to nullptr initialization of spanified member field to {}.

## Reason
The rewriter changed the type of `nativeRow` to `base::span<const SkColor>`, but the initialization in the conditional operator `?:` was left as `{}`. Initializer lists are not allowed in this context. The correct initialization for a span with no underlying data is to use the default constructor, which is equivalent to initializing with `nullptr`.

## Solution
The rewriter should be updated to handle spanified variables that occur on the RHS of a conditional operator by using the default constructor (i.e. `nullptr`).
Replace ` : {};` with ` : nullptr;`.

## Note
The secondary errors stem from the fact that the span variable is potentially empty, and the code then uses `nativeRow[x]`, which would crash if `nativeRow` is empty. In the new span world, code has to check `.empty()` before accessing it, or use `subspan()` with carefully selected sizes.
