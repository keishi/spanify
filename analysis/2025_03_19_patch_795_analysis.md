## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code is calling `.subspan()` on a `base::span<uint8_t>`, and the argument to `subspan()` is the result of integer arithmetic. The error occurs within the `StrictNumeric` constructor, which calls `strict_cast`.

```c++
base::span<uint8_t> pixel = base::span<unsigned char>(input_colors)
                                        .subspan(4 * (x + rect.width() * y));
```

The expression `4 * (x + rect.width() * y)` is of type `int`, but the subspan method expects an unsigned value.

## Solution
The rewriter should cast the result of the arithmetic expression to `size_t` before passing it to `subspan()`.

```c++
base::span<uint8_t> pixel = base::span<unsigned char>(input_colors)
                                        .subspan(static_cast<size_t>(4 * (x + rect.width() * y)));
```

This error is an instance of the "Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value." category.
