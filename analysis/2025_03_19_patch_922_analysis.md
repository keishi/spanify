# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_922

## First error

../../components/feedback/redaction_tool/url_canon_ip.cc:451:32: error: no matching function for call to '_strtoui64'

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The original code was passing a `char[5]` to `_strtoui64`, which expects a `const char*`. The rewriter converted the `char[5]` to `std::array<char, 5>`, but failed to also insert `.data()` to pass a `const char*` to the function. This is a third-party function (`url_canon_internal.h`) that cannot be modified.

## Solution
The rewriter should add `.data()` when an arrayified variable is passed to a third_party function that expects a `const char*`.
```diff
--- a/components/feedback/redaction_tool/url_canon_ip.cc
+++ b/components/feedback/redaction_tool/url_canon_ip.cc
-  return static_cast<uint16_t>(_strtoui64(buf, nullptr, 16));
+  return static_cast<uint16_t>(_strtoui64(buf.data(), nullptr, 16));

```

## Note
The include statement for `<array>` was added but not used. It should be removed as part of the fix.
