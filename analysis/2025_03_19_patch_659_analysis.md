# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_659

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/tests/gl_copy_texture_CHROMIUM_unittest.cc:366:9: error: reinterpret_cast from 'std::vector<uint8_t>' (aka 'vector<unsigned char>') to 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `texture_data` to `base::span<uint8_t>`, but it left a reinterpret_cast that is applied to it. The error message indicates that it is invalid to directly reinterpret_cast a `span` to a `uint32_t*`.

## Solution
The rewriter should be updated to recognize this pattern and replace the reinterpret_cast with `.data()`. The corrected code should look like this:

```c++
base::span<uint32_t> texture_data32 =
    reinterpret_cast<uint32_t*>(texture_data->data());
```

## Note
The rewriter also spanified `texture_data->data()` on line 367. This could be related to the same issue.
