## First error

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The function `EvdevSetBit` was spanified, but the call site in `EventDeviceInfo`'s method is passing the address of the first element of the `std::array`, i.e., a raw pointer. The rewriter needs to recognize that `EvdevSetBit(&array[0], ...)` is equivalent to `EvdevSetBit(array, ...)`. This seems to be a bug with the rewriter where it failed to recognize a size info unavailable rhs value.

## Solution
The rewriter should replace `&(*out)[0]` with `out` in the `EventDeviceInfo` class to be compatible with the spanified `EvdevSetBit` function. Specifically, the rewriter needs to handle cases where `&array[0]` is used to pass a raw pointer to a function now taking a span.
