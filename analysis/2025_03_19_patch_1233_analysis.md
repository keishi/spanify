# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1233

## First error

../../ui/base/l10n/l10n_util.cc:334:58: error: member reference base type 'const char *const[57]' is not a structure or union
  334 |     return std::binary_search(std::begin(kPlatformLocales.data()),

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
`kPlatformLocales` is a `const char* const[57]`, which is an array of constant C-style strings. The span rewriter incorrectly added `.data()` when calling `std::begin` on `kPlatformLocales`. The fix is to remove the `.data()` since std::begin and std::end can directly take arrays as input.

## Solution
Remove `.data()` from the call to `std::begin`.

## Note
The second error is the same.

The third error is:
```
../../ui/base/l10n/l10n_util.cc:1080:10: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'const char *const[57]' to function return type 'const base::span<char *const>'
 1080 |   return kPlatformLocales;
```

This indicates that the rewriter should not have rewritten `GetPlatformLocalesForTesting()` at all because it is returning a constant array. Rewriting the return type to be a span is incorrect. The function body needs to be modified to return a span.
