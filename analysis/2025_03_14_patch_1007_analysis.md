# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1007

## First error

../../components/os_crypt/sync/kwallet_dbus_unittest.cc:195:38: error: cannot initialize a parameter of type 'const uint8_t **' (aka 'const unsigned char **') with an rvalue of type 'base::span<const uint8_t> *' (aka 'span<const unsigned char> *')
  195 |   EXPECT_TRUE(reader.PopArrayOfBytes(&bytes, &length));
      |                                      ^~~~~~

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `PopArrayOfBytes` expects a `const uint8_t** bytes` but the rewriter changed `bytes` to `base::span<const uint8_t>`, and the code is passing in `&bytes`. The rewriter spanified a function parameter, but it failed to spanify a call site.

## Solution
The spanify tool needs to spanify the call site as well, so `PopArrayOfBytes` can correctly be called with a span. This would likely involve changes to the matcher and rewriter logic to handle the `PopArrayOfBytes` function and its call sites.

## Note
The second error is likely a follow-on error.
