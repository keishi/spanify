# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_796

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/mediastream/media_stream_constraints_util_audio.cc:1269:3: error: non-static data member cannot be constexpr; did you intend to make it static?
 1269 |   constexpr auto kBooleanPropertyContainerInfoMap =
      |   ^
      |   static 

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to define a `constexpr` variable `kBooleanPropertyContainerInfoMap` as a non-static member of the `DeviceContainer` class. This is invalid C++ syntax. The diff shows the rewriter adding `<array>` which likely transitively includes system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors. This is because system headers like `<string.h>` are often wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, which is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition.

## Solution
The rewriter logic should prevent it from adding include headers inside the class declaration.

## Note
The second error is:

```
../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/mediastream/media_stream_constraints_util_audio.cc:1325:22: error: redeclaration of 'kBooleanPropertyContainerInfoMap' with a different type: 'const DeviceContainer::BooleanPropertyContainerInfo[]' vs 'const array<remove_cv_t<BooleanPropertyContainerInfo>, 2UL>' (aka 'const array<blink::(anonymous namespace)::DeviceContainer::BooleanPropertyContainerInfo, 2UL>')
```

The rewriter is trying to rewrite the same variable in a different way, thus causing a conflict.
