## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:773:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'
  773 |   for (base::span<policy::TestProvider> it =
      |                                         ^
  774 |            std::begin(kShortcutSameAsDSPKeywordTestProviders);

## Category
Rewriter doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The rewriter attempted to convert a range-based for loop using `std::begin` and `std::end` to use `base::span`, however the code generated is incorrect. The `it` variable, which is a `base::span<policy::TestProvider>`, is being initialized with the raw pointer returned by `std::begin`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be updated to handle the assignment of a spanified variable from `std::begin` and `std::end`. This could involve using a different type of iterator, or explicitly constructing the span from the beginning and end iterators. This is tricky because you also need to rewrite the comparison from `!=` to something, like comparing the .data() pointers.

## Note
The second error was that `base::span<policy::TestProvider>` cannot be incremented and cannot be compared with `!=`.
