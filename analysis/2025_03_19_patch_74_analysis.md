# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_74

## First error

../../sandbox/linux/bpf_dsl/test_trap_registry_unittest.cc:40:25: error: variable 'funcs' declared with deduced type 'auto' cannot appear in its own initializer

## Category
Rewriter does not handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The code attempts to initialize an array with `std::to_array`, using `funcs.data()` in its own initializer. This creates a circular dependency, because the compiler needs the size information of `funcs` to determine what type to assign to `funcs`.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid applying the transformation when the declared variable is referenced in its own initializer.

## Note

The build log contains an additional error message caused by the first error:
