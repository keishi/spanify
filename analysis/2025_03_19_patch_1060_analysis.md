# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1060

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:580:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified `std::begin` and `std::end`, but the range-for loop was rewritten incorrectly. The loop variable `it` is now of type `base::span<policy::TestProvider>`, but it's being initialized with a raw pointer `policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider*` which is not a valid conversion. The rewriter is not correctly recognizing that `kEmptyFieldTestProviders` should be used as the initializer.

## Solution
The rewriter should preserve the range-for loop with std::begin/end when spanifying. A variable of type `base::span` should be initialized with a range expression and not with a pointer. The rewriter should not be modifying the loop.

## Note
The second error is `../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:582:11: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<policy::TestProvider>' and 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *')`.
This shows that the rewriter replaced `auto* it = std::begin(...)` with `base::span<policy::TestProvider> it = std::begin(...)`. So `it` is not a pointer anymore.
The last error `../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:582:50: error: cannot increment value of type 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'` shows that `++it` is not valid because `it` is a span and not an iterator.
