# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1407

## First error
../../chrome/browser/autocomplete/search_provider_unittest.cc:1589:16: error: no matching function for call to 'to_array'

## Category
Rewriter cannot get the size of forward declared array variable.

## Reason
The code uses `std::to_array` to initialize a variable named `cases`. The size of array `matches` which is a member of struct `Cases` is declared with a size of 6. The compiler is unable to infer the size required for `std::to_array` as it requires the size to be known when initializing the array of structs. It needs to be `std::to_array<Cases, 1>({ ... })`.

## Solution
The rewriter cannot know the correct size for the `std::to_array`, so it shouldn't be rewritten. It needs to be skipped.

## Note
The original code used a C-style array, which decays into a pointer when passed to a function. The new code should use `std::array`, which is a fixed-size array that does not decay into a pointer.
