# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_657

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/tests/gl_copy_texture_CHROMIUM_unittest.cc:340:9: error: reinterpret_cast from 'std::vector<uint8_t>' (aka 'vector<unsigned char>') to 'uint16_t *' (aka 'unsigned short *') is not allowed
  340 |         reinterpret_cast<uint16_t*>(*texture_data);
      |         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified texture_data, but left a reinterpret_cast that is applied to it. Rewriter needs to be able to remove it. The `*texture_data` is a `std::vector<uint8_t>`, and the code attempts to cast that to `uint16_t*`. This is an unsafe operation even before the span conversion.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be updated to remove the reinterpret_cast when spanifying a variable.

## Note
texture_data is a std::vector, and not a C-style array. Therefore spanifying it does not make much sense because a std::vector already has size information available.
