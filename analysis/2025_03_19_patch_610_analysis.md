# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_610

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
In the original code, `plane_sizes[i]` is of type `size_t`, which is `unsigned long` on the build machine. The `subspan()` method of `base::span` takes a `StrictNumeric<size_t>` as an argument. However, when rewriting the code, the rewriter failed to generate an appropriate cast, leading to an implicit conversion from `unsigned long*` to `StrictNumeric<unsigned long>`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate an explicit cast to size_t when calling `subspan()` with `plane_sizes[i]`.  Wrap `plane_sizes[i]` in `static_cast<size_t>()`.

```c++
src_plane_memory = src_plane_memory.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(plane_sizes[i]));
```

## Note
There's also a secondary error. The index operator[] on `subspan()` needs `.data()` too, but that is secondary.
