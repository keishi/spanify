# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1221

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/core/inspector/v8_inspector_string.h:80:60: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('const base::span<uint8_t>' (aka 'const span<unsigned char>') and 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned long'))

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the return value of `data()`, but the code that used it was trying to perform pointer arithmetic on the span itself, rather than on the data the span points to. In this case the iterator `begin()` was implemented as `return UNSAFE_BUFFERS(iterator(data().data(), data() + size()));` so the `+` operation is now between the `base::span` object and the size.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to rewrite `data() + size()` to `data().data() + size()`

## Note
There were additional errors after the first error. They all have the same cause.
