# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_642

## First error

../../mojo/public/cpp/bindings/lib/sync_handle_registry.cc:150:20: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'Handle *' to 'base::span<Handle, 1>'

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The function `Wait` in `SyncHandleRegistry` was spanified to accept a `base::span<Handle>` for the `ready_handles` argument. However, the rewriter failed to properly convert the raw pointer `&ready_handle` to a `base::span<Handle, 1>` at the call site in `SyncHandleRegistry::Wait`. The error message indicates there's "no matching conversion" because the conversion from `Handle*` to `base::span<Handle, 1>` is not automatically provided, and the rewriter didn't generate the explicit conversion code.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be improved to correctly handle raw pointers when calling spanified functions. Specifically, when a raw pointer is passed where a `base::span` is expected, the rewriter should generate the correct code to construct a `base::span` from the pointer and its size.

In this case, the rewriter should emit:
```c++
base::span<Handle, 1>(&ready_handle)
```

## Note
The same error occurs in `mojo/public/cpp/system/tests/wait_set_unittest.cc`. It is likely that fixing the rewriter logic to handle this specific pattern will fix all the errors.
