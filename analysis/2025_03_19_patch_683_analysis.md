# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_683

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/audio/vector_math_test.cc:245:12: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'value_type' (aka 'std::array<float, 519>') to function return type 'const float *'
  245 |     return sources_[i];
      |            ^~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The code was rewritten to use `std::array` for the `sources_` member. This resulted in `sources_[i]` returning a `std::array` object. The function's return type `const float*` is no longer compatible with the return value. The rewriter should have added `.data()` to the return value of `sources_[i]` to make it compatible with the expected raw pointer type.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to add `.data()` to the return value to explicitly convert the returned `std::array` to a pointer:

```diff
-    return sources_[i];
+    return sources_[i].data();
```

## Note
The remaining errors are all caused by the same issue: failure to account for spanification/arrayification of `sources_`.
