# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_366

## First error

../../chrome/browser/devtools/device/usb/android_usb_device.cc:366:39: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>') to 'const uint32_t *' (aka 'const unsigned int *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter has spanified a variable but left a reinterpret_cast that is applied to it. Rewriter needs to be able to remove it. In this case, `buffer` was converted to `base::span<const uint8_t>`, but the code still tries to `reinterpret_cast` it to `const uint32_t*`. This is not allowed.

## Solution
The rewriter should either remove the `reinterpret_cast` entirely or use `as_bytes()` or a similar approach to get a `base::span<const uint8_t>` before using the `reinterpret_cast`. The proper fix will depend on the intended behavior of the code.
