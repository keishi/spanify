## First error

../../remoting/base/compound_buffer.cc:153:10: error: no viable conversion from 'net::IOBufferWithSize' to 'base::span<char>'

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The `CopyTo` function is now spanified and expects a `base::span<char>` argument, but the call site `CopyTo(*result, total_bytes_)` is passing a `net::IOBufferWithSize` object directly, which cannot be implicitly converted to a `base::span<char>`. The `net::IOBufferWithSize` class likely manages its own internal buffer.

## Solution
The solution is to access the underlying buffer from the `net::IOBufferWithSize` object and create a span from that. The underlying buffer can be accessed through `result->data()`. The complete span can then be constructed using `base::span(result->data(), total_bytes_)` and passed to the `CopyTo` function.

```c++
  CopyTo(base::span<char>(result->data(), total_bytes_), total_bytes_);
```

## Note
The second error occurred within `base/numerics/safe_conversions.h`, indicating an issue with strict casting when instantiating a function template specialization. This is a secondary error related to the use of `bytes_to_copy` in the`memcpy` line and would likely be fixed by addressing the primary error regarding the `net::IOBufferWithSize`.
