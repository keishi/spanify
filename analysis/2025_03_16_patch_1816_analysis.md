# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_16_patch_1816

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder.cc:8737:27: error: const_cast from 'base::span<const volatile GLfloat>' (aka 'span<const volatile float>') to 'const GLfloat *' (aka 'const float *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified `GLES2DecoderImpl::DoUniform3fv`, but it is called from `GLES2DecoderImpl::HandleUniform3f` which is autogenerated. We shouldn't spanify functions that require rewriting excluded code.

The code attempts to use `const_cast` which is not allowed and also incorrect, and even if it were allowed, `span<T>` and `T*` are different types, so `const_cast` is not appropriate here.

## Solution
Revert the spanification of `GLES2DecoderImpl::DoUniform3fv` to avoid forcing changes in autogenerated code.
## Note
Secondary errors:
```
../../gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h:3462:33: error: no viable conversion from 'const volatile GLfloat *' (aka 'const volatile float *') to 'base::span<const volatile GLfloat>' (aka 'span<const volatile float> ')
 3462 |   DoUniform3fv(location, count, v);
```
This error will be resolved with the fix.
