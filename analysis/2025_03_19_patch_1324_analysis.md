# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1324

## First error

../../chrome/browser/apps/icon_standardizer_unittest.cc:34:23: error: no viable conversion from 'uint8_t *' (aka 'unsigned char *') to 'base::span<uint8_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned char>')

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The function `AreBitmapsEqual` takes a `base::span<uint8_t>` parameter, but the code is passing `reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(second_bitmap.getPixels())` which is a raw pointer. The rewriter failed to create the span from the raw pointer. This is likely because the rewriter didn't recognize the `second_bitmap.getPixels()` call as something it could derive size information from.

## Solution
The rewriter should be able to handle this conversion and generate the correct span. The size of the bitmap needs to be incorporated into the generated code.

## Note
The code is trying to assign a raw pointer to a span. This is not a valid conversion. The span needs to be constructed with a size and a pointer.
