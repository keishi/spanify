## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code attempts to implicitly convert an `int` to `unsigned long`, inside `set_u64le` which calls `subspan(0)`. This implicit conversion invokes the `strict_cast` function, which is part of the `SafeNumerics` library in Chromium. The `strict_cast` function is designed to prevent unsafe numeric conversions, and in this case, it prevents the conversion from `int` to `unsigned long` (aka `size_t` on this platform) because `strict_cast` doesn't allow lossy conversions.

The root cause is that the compiler deduces the literal `0` as `int` and `subspan`'s parameter expects an unsigned type.

## Solution
The rewriter should cast the literal argument `0` to `subspan` to an unsigned type. For example:

```c++
  set_u64le(base::span<uint8_t>(data).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(0)), d);
```
