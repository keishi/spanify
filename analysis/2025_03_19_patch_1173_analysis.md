## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code attempts to create a `base::span` from `kWriteData` and then take a subspan using `kWriteDataSize / 2`. However, `kWriteDataSize` is a signed integer, and `subspan()` requires an unsigned integer. The compiler fails to find a matching function because `strict_cast` is needed to convert the signed value to an unsigned value for the `subspan` call, which the rewriter did not do.

## Solution
The rewriter must add a cast to `size_t` when calling `subspan` with a signed integer, such as `static_cast<size_t>(kWriteDataSize / 2)`.

## Note
The other errors were caused by not adding `.data()` when passing `std::array` to `net::MockWrite`. Adding the cast will not resolve these errors, so consider this a secondary error.
