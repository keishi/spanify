# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1056

## First error

../../ui/gfx/skbitmap_operations.cc:682:26: error: no viable conversion from 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<uint32_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned int>')
  682 |     base::span<uint32_t> image_row = image.getAddr32(0, y);
      |                          ^           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The error occurs because the rewriter attempts to directly assign the raw pointer returned by `image.getAddr32(0, y)` to a `base::span<uint32_t>`.  However, `base::span` requires size information to be properly constructed, which is not available in this assignment.  `image.getAddr32` is a third-party function, and the rewriter needs to generate a span from its return value, but it is failing to do so.

## Solution
The rewriter should generate code to construct a `base::span` from the raw pointer returned by `image.getAddr32()`, explicitly specifying the size of the span if it can be determined. Because the size of the row can be easily inferred from image.width(), construct a span that has a defined size.

Example:
```c++
-   uint32_t* image_row = image.getAddr32(0, y);
+  base::span<uint32_t> image_row(image.getAddr32(0, y), image.width());
```

## Note
The rewriter made the mistake of assigning `image.getAddr32(0, y)` to `base::span<uint32_t> image_row`, but `image.getAddr32()` returns `uint32_t*`, not `base::span<uint32_t>`. Because size information is unavailable from the return value, the rewriter should construct the span with explicit size information. Also, `SkBitmap::getAddr32()` is third party code.
