## First error

../../media/muxers/mp4_movie_box_writer.cc:164:30: error: no viable conversion from 'const int *' to 'base::span<const int>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid use of iterators on base::span

## Reason
The generated code attempts to initialize a `base::span<const int>` with the result of `std::begin(kDisplayIdentityMatrix)`. However, `std::begin` returns a raw pointer (`const int*`), and there is no implicit conversion from a raw pointer to a `base::span<const int>`.

Furthermore, `base::span<const int>` has a constructor that takes a raw pointer, but this only works when the size is known at compile time, which is not the case here.

In addition, it looks like the generated code tries to use increment operator `++` on the span object itself. But span iterators are raw pointers, and the loop condition tests iterator and `std::end`, so the rewriter should introduce `span::begin` and `span::end` and iterate those, rather than the span itself.

## Solution

The rewriter needs to avoid use of iterators on `base::span` and use a range-based for loop.
Here is the original code:

```c++
for (auto* it = std::begin(kDisplayIdentityMatrix);
     it != std::end(kDisplayIdentityMatrix); ++it) {
  writer.WriteU32(*it);
}
```

The rewriter should generate this code:

```c++
for (const int value : kDisplayIdentityMatrix) {
  writer.WriteU32(value);
}
```

## Note

Additional errors show that the rewriter also produced an invalid comparison operator and an invalid increment operation.
