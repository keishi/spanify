## First error

../../media/mojo/clients/mojo_audio_encoder_unittest.cc:300:13: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::HeapArray<uint8_t>' (aka 'HeapArray<unsigned char>') to 'const float *' is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
Rewriter has spanified a variable but left a reinterpret_cast that is applied to it. The `output.encoded_data` member was of type `base::HeapArray<uint8_t>`, which seems to have been implicitly converted to `base::span<uint8_t>`.

## Solution
The rewriter should be able to remove it, or rewrite the code to perform an equivalent, valid conversion to span. In this particular case, `output.encoded_data` could likely be converted to `base::span<const float>` without a reinterpret cast. This would require changing the type of `output.encoded_data` to be `base::HeapArray<float>`.
