# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1703

## First error

../../testing/libfuzzer/proto/skia_image_filter_proto_converter.cc:1112:30: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('const uint8_t *' (aka 'const unsigned char *') and 'base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>'))
 1112 |   for (intptr_t count = stop - src; count > 0; count = stop - src) {
      |                         ~~~~ ^ ~~~

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The code calculates a count by subtracting a span and raw pointer. The rewriter spanified `src`, but not `stop`, so we have a type mismatch.

## Solution
The rewriter should add `.data()` to `stop` so the types match.

* Type mismatch in subtraction
* No matching function call to strict_cast
* Cannot increment base::span
* Invalid operands to binary expression.
