# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1132

## First error

../../ui/events/ozone/evdev/microphone_mute_switch_event_converter_evdev.cc:23:30: error: member reference base type 'unsigned long[1]' is not a structure or union
   23 |             EVIOCGSW((bitmask.size() * sizeof(decltype(bitmask)::value_type))),
      |                       ~~~~~~~^~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The code uses `bitmask.size()` to calculate the size of the bitmask array. However, the rewriter converted `bitmask` to `base::span<unsigned long>`. The `size()` method on `base::span` doesn't return the size of the underlying array but the number of elements in the span. The `EVIOCGSW` ioctl expects the size of the underlying data structure, which should be `sizeof(bitmask)`.  The rewriter failed to account for this and did not create code to calculate the correct size of the bitmask.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate code to correctly calculate the size of the underlying array when a spanified variable is used in an ioctl call with `EVIOCGSW`. The rewriter should replace `bitmask.size() * sizeof(decltype(bitmask)::value_type)` with something like `sizeof(bitmask[0]) * bitmask.size()`

## Note
There are multiple instances of this issue in the patch.
