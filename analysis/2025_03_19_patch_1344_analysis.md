## First error

third_party/blink/renderer/core/xml/xpath_grammar_generated.h:1466:35: error: expected expression
 1466 |     const std::array<signed char, > yycheck_;
      |                                   ^

## Category
Rewriter cannot get the size of forward declared array variable.

## Reason
The rewriter tried to rewrite `yycheck_` to `std::array`, but it is only forward declared without a size.

## Solution
The rewriter should not attempt to rewrite array variables unless the size is available.

```c++
     static const signed char yytable_[];

-    static const signed char yycheck_[];
+    const std::array<signed char, kSize> yycheck_;
```

In this case, because `yycheck_` is private, the code can be manually updated to include a size in the .h file instead.
