# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1401

## First error

../../content/browser/byte_stream_unittest.cc:47:22: error: no viable conversion from 'net::IOBufferWithSize' to 'base::span<char>'
   47 |     base::span<char> bufferp = *buffer;
      |                      ^         ~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from an IOBuffer.

## Reason
The code is attempting to assign the raw `net::IOBufferWithSize` object to `base::span<char>`.  The `net::IOBuffer` class does not directly convert to a span.  It provides access to the underlying buffer via the `data()` method.  The span also requires a size, which is available through `buffer->size()`. The rewriter needs to generate code that constructs a span, using `buffer->data()` for the pointer and `buffer->size()` for the extent.

## Solution
The rewriter should generate the correct code to create a `base::span` from a `net::IOBuffer`. For example:
```c++
// Old code:
char *bufferp = buffer.data();

// New code:
base::span<char> bufferp(buffer->data(), buffer->size());
```

## Note
The second error, `no matching member function for call to 'push_back'`, is a consequence of failing to create a valid span, leading to type mismatch issues later in the code.
