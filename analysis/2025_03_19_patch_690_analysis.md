# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_690

## First error

../../components/headless/screen_info/headless_screen_info.cc:93:51: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
   93 |       return kInvalidScreenDevicePixelRatio.data().subspan(std)::string(value);
      |              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified `kInvalidScreenDevicePixelRatio` to `std::array<char, 36>`, then added `.data()` to pass it to `std::string` constructor. However, it also seems to have attempted to apply a `.subspan()` replacement (likely based on some other rule), which resulted in invalid syntax `...data().subspan(std)::string(value)`.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid conflicting replacements for `.data()` and `.subspan()`. A possible fix is to ensure only one of these replacements is applied, or to adjust the replacement logic to correctly handle both operations in a single step.

## Note
There were 3 errors in total, but the first one is the root cause.
