## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h:834:27: error: no viable conversion from 'const volatile GLuint *' (aka 'const volatile unsigned int *') to 'base::span<const volatile GLuint>' (aka 'span<const volatile unsigned int>

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The error occurs because `gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h` is generated code, so it is excluded from the rewriter. However, the rewriter modified `DeleteTexturesHelper` to take a `base::span`, which requires modifications to the call site in the generated code. The compiler cannot find a viable conversion from `const volatile GLuint *` to `base::span<const volatile GLuint>`.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid spanifying `DeleteTexturesHelper` to prevent rewriting excluded code.

## Note
The error message indicates that the compiler cannot convert `const volatile GLuint *` to `base::span<const volatile GLuint>`. This is because the function `DeleteTexturesHelper` was spanified, but the code in `gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h` calling it was not rewritten, since the file is excluded.
