# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_16_patch_193

## First error

../../base/substring_set_matcher/substring_set_matcher.cc:466:33: error: no viable conversion from 'AhoCorasickEdge *' to 'base::span<AhoCorasickEdge>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to construct a span from a raw pointer returned by `new`.

## Reason
The code attempts to assign a raw pointer obtained from `new AhoCorasickEdge[new_capacity]` directly to a `base::span<AhoCorasickEdge>` object. `base::span` does not have an implicit conversion constructor from a raw pointer. It requires explicit construction, using the pointer and the size of the memory region.

## Solution
Change line 466 from:
```c++
base::span<AhoCorasickEdge> new_edges = new AhoCorasickEdge[new_capacity];
```
to:
```c++
base::span<AhoCorasickEdge> new_edges(new AhoCorasickEdge[new_capacity], new_capacity);
```
This constructs the `span` correctly by providing both the pointer and the size, satisfying the requirements of the `base::span` constructor. Also, change line 475 to:
```c++
edges_.edges = new_edges.data();
```
to ensure that the raw pointer `edges_.edges` is assigned the raw pointer from the `span` and not the `span` itself.

## Note
The lifetime of the pointer must be managed correctly. The `new` operator requires a matching `delete[]` operator called later. If not, there is a memory leak.

There is a secondary error reported in the build log which results from attempting to assign a `base::span` type to a raw pointer. This will be fixed with the above suggestions.
