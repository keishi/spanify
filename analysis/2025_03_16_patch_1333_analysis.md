# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_16_patch_1333

## First error

../../media/mojo/mojom/stable/stable_video_decoder_types_mojom_traits_unittest.cc:133:33: error: no member named 'subspan' in 'std::array<unsigned int, 4>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to add `.data()` to arrayified variable used with `.subspan()`.

## Reason
The code attempts to call `.subspan()` on a `std::array`, but then also calls `.data()` on the result. `.subspan()` is not a member of `std::array`, but is only supported on `base::span`. This happened because a C-style array was converted to a `std::array`, but the spanify tool failed to add the `.data()` to the variable before calling `.subspan()`. 

## Solution
The rewriter should add `.data()` to the variable before `.subspan()` is called on it.

```c++
kInvalidSpatialLayers --> kInvalidSpatialLayers.data()
```

## Note
There were no other errors.
