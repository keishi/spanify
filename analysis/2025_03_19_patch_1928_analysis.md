# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1928

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/graphics/gpu/webgl_image_conversion_test.cc:47:54: error: member reference base type 'uint8_t[36]' (aka 'unsigned char[36]') is not a structure or union

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The error occurs because after spanifying the `Unpack` function, the test code still treats `destination_data` as an array instead of calling `.data()` on the span. This causes issues when trying to access members like `.data()` or `.size()`, which are valid for spans but not for raw arrays. The rewriter should have updated the test code to account for the change in type from `uint8_t*` to `base::span<uint8_t>`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to update the test cases to use the `base::span` interface. In particular, add `.data()` after `destination_data` for the call to memcmp.

## Note
Additional errors in the log are all related to the same root cause, suggesting that the rewriter missed multiple locations where the spanified variable `destination_data` was used incorrectly. Also the code calls `destination = destination.subspan(4)` after using destination. It should have called that before, or used a different indexing method.
