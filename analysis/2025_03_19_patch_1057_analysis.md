# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1057

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:496:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The loop is trying to initialize a `base::span<policy::TestProvider>` with a raw pointer `policy::TestProvider *` obtained from `std::begin(kMissingRequiredFieldsTestProviders)`. The compiler reports "no viable conversion". It seems that rewriter didn't properly recognize that the iterator points to an array.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be able to properly handle the case where a raw pointer is used to initialize the `span`. The code needs to use the `base::span` constructor correctly given the raw pointer to the array.

## Note
The second error occurs because after the failed conversion to `base::span`, the loop attempts to increment the `base::span<policy::TestProvider>` object, which is not a valid operation for spans. The rewriter should generate valid span initialization before fixing this.
