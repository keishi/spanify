## First error

../../ui/events/devices/x11/device_data_manager_x11.cc:363:16: error: cannot increment value of type 'base::span<const x11::Input::Fp3232>'
  363 |       valuators++;
      |       ~~~~~~~~~^

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying a variable used in pointer arithmetic.

## Reason
The rewriter changed `x11::Input::Fp3232* valuators` to `base::span<const x11::Input::Fp3232> valuators`.  The code then attempts to increment valuators, but you can't increment a span object.  The spanification is invalid because it fundamentally changes the behavior of the code. The original code uses pointer arithmetic to iterate but that is no longer possible after the conversion.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid rewriting pointer variables that are being incremented/decremented in a loop.

## Note
The original code also indexes into `valuators` using `valuators[0]`. After changing valuators to span, the code will still work but should be updated to use iterators instead.
