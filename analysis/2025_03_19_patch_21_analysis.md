# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_21

## First error

Overlapping replacements: ./base/strings/safe_sprintf_unittest.cc at offset 4805, length 12: "std::array<char, 20> ref" and offset 4805, length 21: "std::array<char, 20> buf"

## Category
Overlapping replacements due to multiple variable declaration.

## Reason
The rewriter attempts to rewrite multiple variable declarations in a single DeclStmt, resulting in overlapping replacements because the replacements are generated independently and then applied simultaneously.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be smarter about handling multiple variable declarations within a single DeclStmt. It should either:
1.  Rewrite only one variable declaration at a time.
2.  Combine the replacements into a single, larger replacement that encompasses the entire DeclStmt.

## Note
Similar error occurs in ./base/strings/safe_sprintf_unittest.cc at offset 2228.
