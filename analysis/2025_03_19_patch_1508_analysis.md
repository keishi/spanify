# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1508

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The error occurs because the argument passed to `.subspan()` needs to be cast to an unsigned value. This is due to the implementation of `strict_cast` within `safe_conversions.h` requiring a specific type match.

## Solution
The rewriter should add a `static_cast<size_t>()` or `static_cast<unsigned>()` around the argument passed to the `.subspan()` method to ensure it is an unsigned value. This will prevent the `strict_cast` from failing.

For example, the generated code:

```c++
values.subspan(count).data()
```

Should become:

```c++
values.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(count)).data()
```

## Note

The second error also relates to an invalid conversion. This is because gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h is generated code, so it is excluded from the rewriter. Thus we shouldn't spanify functions that require rewriting excluded code.
```
../../gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h:3242:33: error: no viable conversion from 'const volatile GLint *' (aka 'const volatile int *') to 'base::span<const volatile GLint>' (aka 'span<const volatile int>')
 3242 |   DoUniform1iv(location, count, v);
      |                                 ^
```
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.
