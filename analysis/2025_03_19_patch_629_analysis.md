# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_629

## First error

../../remoting/host/linux/unicode_to_keysym.cc:820:29: error: use of undeclared identifier 'base'

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The code attempts to call `base::span` on `kKeySymUnicodeMap` and then get `data()` which is not allowed by the rewriter. It first must subspan the result. It seems like this is because a rewrite to use `subspan` was missed here.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize that calling `data()` on a spanified return value is invalid, and should apply `subspan` rewrite for it.
For this specific case, the rewriter should add a `.subspan()` call.

## Note
It would be great if the rewriter could detect this automatically and apply a `.data()` and `.subspan()` call to make it clear that the rewriter is addressing a spanified value.
