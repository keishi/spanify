# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_16_patch_119

## First error

../../net/ntlm/ntlm_buffer_writer.h:184:59: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'const std::vector<uint8_t>' (aka 'const vector<unsigned char>') to function return type 'const base::span<uint8_t>' (aka 'const span<unsigned char>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to support implicit conversion from vector to span.

## Reason
The rewriter changed the return type of `GetBufferPtr()` from `const uint8_t*` to `const base::span<uint8_t>`. However, the implementation attempts to directly return the `buffer_` member, which is a `std::vector<uint8_t>`. There is no implicit conversion from `std::vector<uint8_t>` to `base::span<uint8_t>`.

```c++
  184 |   const base::span<uint8_t> GetBufferPtr() const { return buffer_; }
      |                                                           ^~~~~~~
```

## Solution
The rewriter should generate code to construct a `base::span` from the `std::vector`. The `base::span` can be constructed implicitly. Use `.data()` and `.size()` to create the span.

```c++
  const base::span<uint8_t> GetBufferPtr() const { return {buffer_.data(), buffer_.size()}; }
```

## Note
The other errors:
1. `../../net/ntlm/ntlm_buffer_writer.cc:31:7: error: expected expression`
2. `../../net/ntlm/ntlm_buffer_writer.cc:31:10: error: expected expression`

are caused by the rewriter inserting code into `if()` which is not valid.

```c++
  if () {.empty())
    return false;
  }
```

The condition for the if statement is not properly handled. Rewriter logic should check if a condition already exists, and not insert invalid code. Since the rewriter added `GetBufferPtr()` and span, it also tried to add `.empty()` since the original code checked if a pointer was empty.

To fix this, the rewriter should only generate valid code. The proper code is shown below.

```c++
  if (GetBufferPtr().empty())
    return false;
