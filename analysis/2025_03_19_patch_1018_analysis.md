# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1018

## First error

../../base/command_line.cc:45:74: error: extraneous ')' before ';'
constexpr std::array<CommandLine::CharType, 2> kSwitchValueSeparator{"="});

## Category
Rewriter cannot get the size of forward declared array variable.

## Reason
Rewriter arrayified a variable, but couldn't determine the size because it is a forward declaration. In this case, the size is known, but the rewriter doesn't have logic to determine it.

## Solution
The rewriter should be able to handle arrayifying variables whose sizes are known.

## Note
Extra errors are as follows:
*   no matching function for call to 'StrAppend'
*   member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
