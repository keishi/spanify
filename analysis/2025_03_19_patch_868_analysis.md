# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_868

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/client/raster_implementation_gles.cc:182:51: error: expected expression
  182 |       base::span<GLbyte>(mailboxes).subspan(sizeof).data()(source_mailbox.name),
      |                                                   ^

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The rewriter added both `.data()` and `.subspan()` replacements to the same span, but failed to apply them in the correct order or with the correct syntax. The line:

```c++
base::span<GLbyte>(mailboxes).subspan(sizeof).data()(source_mailbox.name),
```

Is trying to call `.data()` on the result of `subspan`, but it generates invalid code. `sizeof` is being used as an argument, and then `.data()` is being called as if it were a function.

## Solution
The correct code should be:

```c++
base::span<GLbyte>(mailboxes).subspan(sizeof(source_mailbox.name)).data()
```

The rewriter's replacement logic needs to be fixed to account for this combined usage of `.subspan()` and `.data()`.  It should generate replacements that result in valid C++ syntax.

## Note
There are similar errors further in the file with other instances of `subspan` and `data`. These will likely be fixed when the first error is resolved.
