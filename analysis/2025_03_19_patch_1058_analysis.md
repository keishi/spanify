# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1058

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:523:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified a variable, but failed to spanify a call site. The code is trying to initialize a `base::span<policy::TestProvider>` from a `policy::TestProvider*`. This implies that the spanification failed to recognize the correct way to pass the pointer into the now spanified function.  The error message "no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'" indicates that there's no implicit conversion available, and the rewriter didn't generate an explicit conversion.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be able to recognize a call site with size info unavailable rhs value. More specifically:

1. Identify the `std::begin` iterator.
2. Recognize that this `std::begin` iterator points to a raw C-style array where it is impossible to determine the size.
3. Fix that the `base::span` argument `it` in the for loop in question is assigned a raw pointer. Rewriter should be able to wrap this variable with the appropriate base::span initialization code.

## Note
The second error is "cannot increment value of type 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'". It is a follow up error after failing to construct base::span in the first place.
