## First error

../../ui/gfx/skbitmap_operations.cc:682:26: error: no viable conversion from 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<uint32_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned int>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The code attempts to assign a raw pointer returned by `image.getAddr32()` to a `base::span`. `image.getAddr32` is a third-party function that returns a raw pointer. The rewriter should have generated code to explicitly construct a `base::span` from the raw pointer.

## Solution
The rewriter should wrap the call to `image.getAddr32()` with code that constructs a `base::span` from the returned pointer. The code should look like this:
```c++
base::span<uint32_t> image_row = base::span(image.getAddr32(0, y), image.width());
```
The rewriter needs to understand to use the second argument in the existing code `image.width()` as the bound for the generated span.

## Note
The error message indicates that the `base::span` constructor expects either another `base::span`, an array, or iterators. It cannot implicitly convert from a raw pointer (`uint32_t*`). The third_party function `SkBitmap::getAddr32` is defined in `third_party/skia/include/core/SkBitmap.h`.
