# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_229

## First error

../../components/webrtc_logging/common/partial_circular_buffer_unittest.cc:216:12: error: no template named 'span' in namespace 'base'; did you mean 'std::span'?
  216 |     memcpy(base::span<uint8_t>(large_input).subspan(offset).data(), kInputData,
      |            ^~~~~~~~~~
      |            std::span

## Category
Rewriter used `base::span` but it needs `std::span` in this context.

## Reason
The code was rewritten to use `base::span`, but the include `<array>` was added and did not include `<base/containers/span.h>`. As a result, the compiler used `std::span` instead of `base::span`, which led to the issue at hand.

## Solution
Instead of rewriting `uint8_t large_input[kLargeSize] = {};` to `std::array<uint8_t, kLargeSize> large_input = {};` the patch should use `base::span` in conjunction with the C-style array, like so: `base::span<uint8_t> large_input(new uint8_t[kLargeSize], kLargeSize);`
Then, to avoid the other issues, it needs to call: `memcpy(large_input.data(), kInputData, kInputSize);`

## Note
The secondary error is due to the fact that `std::array` is not implicitly convertible to `const void*`.
