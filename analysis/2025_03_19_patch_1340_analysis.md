# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1340

## First error

../../ui/events/ozone/evdev/event_converter_evdev_impl.cc:116:22: error: member reference base type 'input_event[4]' is not a structure or union
  116 |       read(fd, inputs.data(),

## Category
Rewriter needs to add .data() when converting a C-style array to std::array in a third_party function call.

## Reason
The rewriter is converting a C-style array `inputs` to `base::span`. However, the variable is passed to `read` a system library function. The function expects a pointer, but `.data()` was not added to the spanified variable.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize this pattern and add `.data()` to `inputs` in the `read` call. The replacement should be:
```
read(fd, inputs.data(),
```

## Note
The code also has a similar issue in the next line
```
(inputs.size() * sizeof(decltype(inputs)::value_type)))
```
The `decltype(inputs)::value_type` is also a problem because now `inputs` is a span, not an array. This can be solved by `sizeof(inputs[0])`. This could be added as an extra pattern to the rewriter.
