# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1749

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The rewriter is passing `3` as an argument to `subspan()`. However, `subspan()` takes a `size_t` as an argument, which is an unsigned integer type. The `strict_cast` is failing because it does not allow implicit conversions from signed to unsigned integers.

## Solution
The rewriter should explicitly cast the argument to `subspan()` to `size_t` to avoid the signed to unsigned conversion. For example, the code should be changed to:
```c++
base::span<MojoHandle> consumers = base::span<MojoHandle>(handles).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(3));
```
