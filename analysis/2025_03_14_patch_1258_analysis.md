# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1258

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan` method of `base::span` requires an unsigned integer as its argument. In this case, the value `4` is being implicitly converted from an `int` to `size_t` (which is typically an `unsigned long` on 64 bit systems) through the `StrictNumeric` class. However, the compiler is unable to find an appropriate overload of `strict_cast` for this conversion, since it could potentially truncate the value.

## Solution
Cast the integer literal 4 to `size_t` before passing it to `subspan`.

```c++
source = source.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(4));
```

## Note
Several errors are present after the first one. The first one is a type mismatch, where an lvalue reference is used instead of `base::span`. This is because after spanifying Pack(), it is also necessary to update the call sites of Pack(). This failure is cascading as several Pack<>() functions have this issue.

```
../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/graphics/gpu/webgl_image_conversion.cc:1301:37: error: non-const lvalue reference to type 'const uint8_t *' (aka 'const unsigned char *') cannot bind to a value of unrelated type 'base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>')
 1301 |   simd::PackOneRowOfRGBA8LittleToR8(source, destination, pixels_per_row);
      |                                     ^~~~~~
../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/graphics/cpu/x86/webgl_image_conversion_sse.h:147:64: note: passing argument to parameter 'source' here
  147 | ALWAYS_INLINE void PackOneRowOfRGBA8LittleToR8(const uint8_t*& source,
      |                                                                ^
```

This is a call site for PackOneRowOfRGBA8LittleToR8(). This was not updated to accept `span` types. A fix would be to either update the signatures of these functions, or reinterpret the span back to a pointer. Since this is a third_party function, it should not be spanified. Therefore the span must be converted back to `const uint8_t*`.

```c++
simd::PackOneRowOfRGBA8LittleToR8(source.data(), destination, pixels_per_row);
```

Also, there are cases where `static_cast` from `base::span` to raw pointer `const SrcType*` was inserted, remove these:

```
../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/graphics/gpu/webgl_image_conversion.cc:4087:11: error: cannot cast from type 'base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>') to pointer type 'const SrcType *' (aka 'const unsigned char *')
 4087 |           static_cast<const SrcType*>(source_data);
      |           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Remove the `static_cast`:

```c++
-       const SrcType* src_row_start = static_cast<const SrcType*>(source_data);
+       base::span<const SrcType> src_row_start = source_data;
```
