# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_180

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webaudio/cpu/x86/oscillator_kernel_sse2.cc:262:41: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from '__m128i *' to 'base::span<__m128i, 1>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified a variable but left a reinterpret_cast that is applied to it. The code attempts to cast a `__m128i*` to a `base::span<__m128i, 1>`, and then reinterpret the resulting span as a `const unsigned int*`. This fails because there's no direct conversion from a raw pointer to a span like that. Also, reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<__m128i, 1>' to 'const unsigned int *' is also not allowed.

## Solution
The rewriter should remove the reinterpret_cast, and replace `read1` with a temporary `base::span<const unsigned int, 4>` of `v_read1`.  This is because the original code was using the `__m128i` variable as an array of 4 unsigned ints.

```c++
-  const unsigned* read1 = reinterpret_cast<const unsigned*>(&v_read1);
+  base::span<const unsigned int, 4> read1(reinterpret_cast<const unsigned int*>(&v_read1), 4);
```

## Note

There's also a second error in the same line that's related to the `reinterpret_cast` from `base::span` to `const unsigned int*`. Fixing the root cause with the above replacement should fix the second error as well.
