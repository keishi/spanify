## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan` function takes a `size_t` argument, which is an unsigned integer type. The code passes an integer as the first argument, which triggers a compile error because `strict_cast` does not have an implicit conversion defined from `int` to `size_t`.

## Solution
The rewriter should cast the argument to `subspan` to an unsigned type, such as `static_cast<size_t>()`.

Here is how the line should look:
```c++
std::string(base::span<const char>(kTestData2).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(4)).data(), 5);
