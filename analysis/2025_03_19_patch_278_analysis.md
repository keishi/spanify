# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_278

## First error

../../media/video/gpu_memory_buffer_video_frame_pool_unittest.cc:272:7: error: no viable conversion from 'std::nullptr_t' to 'base::raw_span<uint8_t, DanglingUntriaged | AllowPtrArithmetic>' (aka 'span<unsigned char, dynamic_extent, raw_ptr<unsigned char, (RawPtrTraits)9U | AllowPtrArithmetic>>')
  272 |       nullptr;
      |       ^~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to nullptr initialization of spanified member field to {}.

## Reason
The rewriter introduced a `base::raw_span` member field but failed to change its initialization from `nullptr` to `{}`. `base::raw_span` does not have a constructor that accepts `nullptr`.

## Solution
The rewriter should replace `nullptr` initialization of `base::raw_span` member fields to `{}`.

In this case:

```c++
-  raw_ptr<uint8_t, DanglingUntriaged | AllowPtrArithmetic> uv_data_ = nullptr;
+  base::raw_span<uint8_t, DanglingUntriaged | AllowPtrArithmetic> uv_data_ =
+      nullptr;
```

should be changed to

```c++
-  raw_ptr<uint8_t, DanglingUntriaged | AllowPtrArithmetic> uv_data_ = nullptr;
+  base::raw_span<uint8_t, DanglingUntriaged | AllowPtrArithmetic> uv_data_ =
+      {};
```

## Note
There was also this change:

```c++
-    if (uv_data_)
+    if (!uv_data_.empty()) {
```

This seems correct because `uv_data_` is now a span, and `if (span)` doesn't test for nullness.

Also, there is this change:

```c++
-                                        y_data_,             // y_data
-                                        uv_data_,            // uv_data
+                                        y_data_,             // y_data
+                                        uv_data_.data(),     // uv_data

```

This seems correct as well.
