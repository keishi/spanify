# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1704

## First error
../../testing/libfuzzer/proto/skia_image_filter_proto_converter.cc:204:12: error: unused variable 'kCountNibBits' [-Werror,-Wunused-const-variable]

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The code change introduces a variable `kCountNibBits` but doesn't use it. It appears to be part of an attempted change, but the full implementation is missing. Rewriter shouldn't modify unused code.

## Solution
The rewriter should not generate code for the variable if it is never used.

## Note
No additional errors are shown.
