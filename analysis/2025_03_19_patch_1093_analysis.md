# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1093

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/indexeddb/idb_value_wrapping.cc:347:7: error: reinterpret_cast from 'const Vector<char>' to 'const uint8_t *' (aka 'const unsigned char *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter has spanified a variable but left a reinterpret_cast that is applied to it. The `value->Data()` returns a `Vector<char>`, and the rewriter failed to remove the `reinterpret_cast` after spanifying `value->Data()`.

## Solution
The rewriter should remove the reinterpret_cast from `value->Data()` to `const uint8_t*` because it is no longer necessary after introducing the span.

## Note
There are also errors about invalid operands to binary expression, which may be related to the spanified `data` variable being used in arithmetic operations. The rewriter might need to add `.data()` when performing arithmetic on spanified variables.
