## First error

../../media/parsers/vp9_uncompressed_header_parser.cc:599:7: error: suggest braces around initialization of subobject [-Werror,-Wmissing-braces]
  599 |     {{64, 96, 64}, {64, 96, 64}},

## Category
Rewriter caused invalid initialization of a nested array within `std::array`.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `Vp9Prob mv_fr_probs[2][3];` to `std::array<std::array<Vp9Prob, 3>, 2> mv_fr_probs;`.  The initialization `{{64, 96, 64}, {64, 96, 64}}` now requires explicit braces around each inner array. The compiler is suggesting `{{ {64, 96, 64} }, { {64, 96, 64} }}`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be updated to handle initialization of nested arrays when converting to `std::array`. The rewriter should insert the missing braces. A general solution would involve detecting the initialization of a multi-dimensional array and adding braces around the initializers for each dimension. The logic should verify that the number of initializers matches the array dimensions.

## Note
There are 2 errors, but they are related and are solved by the same fix to the rewriter.
