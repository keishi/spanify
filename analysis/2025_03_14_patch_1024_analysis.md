# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1024

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:707:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to use a compatible type when iterating over container with span.

## Reason
The code attempts to initialize a `base::span<policy::TestProvider>` with a `policy::TestProvider*`, which is not a valid conversion. The iterator type is incompatible with the span's element type. This usually means that the underlying type of `std::begin` and `std::end` are not the same as the `base::span`.

## Solution
Change the iteration to be compatible with `base::span`. Since `kInvalidUrlTestProviders` is likely an array of `policy::TestProvider`, then you can iterate using size_t and access the array with `it[i]`.

```c++
  base::Value::List policy_value;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < std::size(kInvalidUrlTestProviders); ++i) {
    policy_value.Append(GenerateSiteSearchPolicyEntry(kInvalidUrlTestProviders[i]));
  }
```

## Note
The second error is related to the incompatible iterator types as well.
