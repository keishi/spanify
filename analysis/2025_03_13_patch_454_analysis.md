# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_13_patch_454

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/scheduler/main_thread/main_thread_metrics_helper.cc:64:12: error: no viable conversion from 'const char[51]' to 'blink::CustomCountHistogram'

## Category
Rewriter needs to call constructor when arrayifying a variable.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `CustomCountHistogram[]` to `std::array<CustomCountHistogram>`, but the rewriter did not call the constructor. The `CustomCountHistogram` class does not have a default constructor, therefore the code fails to compile.

## Solution
The rewriter should use the constructor for `CustomCountHistogram` when rewriting the array. The constructor should take a `base::HistogramBase*`.
```c++
CustomCountHistogram(base::HistogramBase*);
```
The code should be rewritten to call the constructor with a string literal.
```c++
CustomCountHistogram queueing_delay_histograms_[static_cast<size_t>(TaskPriority::kPriorityCount)] = {
    CustomCountHistogram(QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_NAME("Control")),
    CustomCountHistogram(QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_NAME("UserVisible")),
    CustomCountHistogram(QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_NAME("Background")),
    CustomCountHistogram(QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_NAME("BestEffort")),
    CustomCountHistogram(QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_NAME("Layout")),
    CustomCountHistogram(QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_NAME("VisualUpdate")),
    CustomCountHistogram(QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_NAME("InputHandling")),
    CustomCountHistogram(QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_NAME("Unthrottled")),
    CustomCountHistogram(QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_NAME("Compositing")),
    CustomCountHistogram(QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_NAME("Navigation")),
    CustomCountHistogram(QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_NAME("Timer")),
  };
```

## Note
The other errors are the same as the first one, and they all have the same solution.
