# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1630

## First error

../../ui/gfx/half_float_unittest.cc:63:22: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'float *' to 'base::span<float, 1>'
   63 |     FloatToHalfFloat(base::span<float, 1>(&f), &ret, 1);
      |                      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from a pointer variable.

## Reason
The rewriter created a `base::span` parameter, but failed to update the call site. The code was trying to pass `&f` which is a `float*` into a `base::span<float, 1>`.
The rewriter needs to create a span from the variable. `FloatToHalfFloat(base::span<float, 1>(&f), &ret, 1);` should be rewritten to `FloatToHalfFloat(base::span<float, 1>(&f, 1), &ret, 1);`.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize a function call, and then when spanifying parameters, the rewriter should also update all call sites with either `.data()` or `base::span(..., size)`.

```c++
-    FloatToHalfFloat(base::span<float, 1>(&f), &ret, 1);
+    FloatToHalfFloat(base::span<float, 1>(&f, 1), &ret, 1);
```

## Note
There were no other errors.
