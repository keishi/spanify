## First error

../../chrome/browser/enterprise/reporting/extension_request/extension_request_notification.cc:103:57: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
  103 |                           GURL(kChromeWebstoreUrl.data().subspan(extension_id)),
      |                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The rewriter incorrectly tried to use both `.data()` and `.subspan()` on the `kChromeWebstoreUrl` variable. The variable was changed from `constexpr char kChromeWebstoreUrl[]` to `constexpr std::array<char, 43> kChromeWebstoreUrl`, so the rewriter attempted to use `.data()` to get a pointer and then `.subspan()` on the result, which is invalid.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to avoid applying both `.data()` and `.subspan()` to the same variable. It needs to check if `.data()` has already been applied.

## Note
The surrounding code likely requires a `base::span` and should be rewritten to use it directly from the std::array. The rewriter incorrectly applied fixes for both a char array and a span to the same object.
