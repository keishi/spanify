# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1687

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The error occurs because the `subspan()` method expects an unsigned integer type for its arguments, but the code was passing a signed integer (`int`). The strict_cast function requires that the source type be representable in the destination type without loss of information. The error message "no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'" indicates that there isn't a suitable overload available that can handle the conversion from `int` to `unsigned long` without potential data loss (e.g., if a negative value were passed).

## Solution
The rewriter needs to explicitly cast the argument passed to `subspan()` to an unsigned integer type (e.g., `size_t`) to ensure type compatibility and prevent the build error. The generated code should include a `static_cast<size_t>` or similar cast to resolve the type mismatch.

## Note
The problem occurs at `../../content/browser/blob_storage/blob_url_unittest.cc:304:66`.
