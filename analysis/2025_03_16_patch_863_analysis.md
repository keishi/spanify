# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_16_patch_863

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The rewriter added a `subspan()` call with an integer argument to `base::span`. The `subspan()` function expects its argument to be an unsigned value. The compiler failed to find a matching function because the integer argument wasn't explicitly cast to an unsigned value. The error message "no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'" suggests the compiler is trying to implicitly convert the signed integer to an unsigned type using `strict_cast`, but it's failing because `strict_cast` only allows safe conversions.

## Solution
The rewriter should cast the argument of `subspan()` to an unsigned type (e.g., `static_cast<size_t>`). This will ensure that the correct `subspan()` overload is called.
For example:
```c++
   base::span<ContentAnalysisResponse>(responses).subspan(i).data()
```
should be converted to:
```c++
   base::span<ContentAnalysisResponse>(responses).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(i)).data()
```

## Note
All the failing test cases are in the same file, so it's very likely they share the same root cause.
