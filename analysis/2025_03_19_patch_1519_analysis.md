# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1519

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder.cc:17092:62: error: member reference base type 'int' is not a structure or union
 17092 |   std::vector<GLint> box_copy(box.data(), box.subspan((n * 4).data()));
       |                                                       ~~~~~~~^~~~~

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The code attempts to chain `.data()` after calling `.subspan()` on a `base::span` object. This generates invalid C++ syntax. This indicates the rewriter logic for applying `.data()` and `.subspan()` replacements are conflicting.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid generating both `.data()` and `.subspan()` when the variable is already spanified. It needs to determine whether the `.data()` is required in addition to the `.subspan()` or if the `.data()` is sufficient.

## Note
The build log also shows a second error:

```
../../gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h:5082:38: error: no viable conversion from 'const volatile GLfloat *' (aka 'const volatile float *') to 'base::span<const volatile GLfloat>' (aka 'span<const volatile float>')
 5082 |   DoVertexAttrib2fv(indx, values);
      |                           ^~~~~~
```

This indicates: Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.
