## First error

../../base/threading/thread_local_storage.cc:318:30: error: no viable conversion from 'TlsVectorEntry *' to 'base::span<TlsVectorEntry>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to properly handle the conversion from raw pointer to base::span when the raw pointer is obtained from new[].

## Reason
The rewriter is trying to assign a raw pointer `TlsVectorEntry*` (obtained from `new TlsVectorEntry[kThreadLocalStorageSize]`) directly to a `base::span<TlsVectorEntry>`. The `base::span` constructor does not allow implicit conversion from raw pointer. A `base::span` needs to be constructed with the pointer as well as the size: `base::span(ptr, size)`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate the proper `base::span` constructor with the correct size:

```diff
-  base::span<TlsVectorEntry> tls_data =
+  base::span<TlsVectorEntry> tls_data(
       new TlsVectorEntry[kThreadLocalStorageSize];
+      kThreadLocalStorageSize);
```

## Note
In addition to the first error, there is a similar error in line 334, and another error where SetTlsVectorValue() is called. These should be follow-up errors from the first one. It should be noted that fixing line 318 will not automatically fix the rest.
