# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_16_patch_336

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code uses `std::distance(range.begin(), i) - 1` as an argument to `subspan()`, which results in a signed `long` value. However, the `subspan()` method expects an unsigned value for its offset argument. This causes a compile error because `strict_cast` cannot find a suitable conversion from `long` to `size_t` (unsigned long) when the value is potentially negative.

## Solution
Cast the result of `std::distance(range.begin(), i) - 1` to `size_t` before passing it to `subspan()`.

```c++
base::span<const OffsetMappingUnit> unit =
    base::span<const blink::OffsetMappingUnit>(range).subspan(
        static_cast<size_t>(std::distance(range.begin(), i) - 1));
```

## Note
The other errors are follow-up errors due to failure to instantiate the base::span. The original error is the one related to strict_cast.
