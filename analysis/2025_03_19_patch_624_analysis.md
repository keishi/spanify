# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_624

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_implementation_impl_autogen.h:3080:29: error: no viable conversion from 'const GLuint *' (aka 'const unsigned int *') to 'base::span<const GLuint>' (aka 'span<const unsigned int>')
 3080 |   DeleteQueriesEXTHelper(n, queries);
      |                             ^~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the `DeleteQueriesEXTHelper` function, requiring a `base::span<const GLuint>` argument. However, the call site in `gles2_implementation_impl_autogen.h` is passing a raw `const GLuint*` pointer. The rewriter failed to recognize this call site and perform the necessary conversion to create a `base::span` from the raw pointer. This indicates a problem where the rewriter doesn't fully handle size information being unavailable at the call site.

## Solution
The rewriter must correctly identify all call sites of spanified functions and generate code to construct a `base::span` when a raw pointer is being passed as an argument. In this specific instance, the size (`n`) is available, which should be used to construct the span. The rewriter needs to generate code that creates a base::span from the pointer and the size. `base::span(queries, n)`

## Note
The rewriter spanified a function, but failed to spanify a call site. The original issue happened in autogenerated code, so the source code is different.
