# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_777

## First error

../../media/base/sinc_resampler.cc:139:22: error: assigning to 'ConvolveProc' (aka 'float (*)(const int, const float *, const float *, double)') from incompatible type 'float (const int, const float *, base::span<const float>, const float *, double)': type mismatch at 3rd parameter ('const float *' vs 'base::span<const float>')

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified `SincResampler::Convolve_SSE`, but failed to update the `convolve_proc_` assignment in the constructor. The function pointer expects a `const float*`, but the spanified function now takes `base::span<const float>`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to update the function pointer assignment in the constructor to match the new signature of `SincResampler::Convolve_SSE`. One possible solution is to cast the function pointer to the correct type, but a better solution is to avoid spanifying function pointers in the first place.

## Note
The second error related to `strict_cast` occurs because the code is trying to use a `base::span` object in a context where the compiler expects a `size_t`. The rewriter did not correctly add the `.size()` call.
