# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_854

## First error

../../build/linux/debian_bullseye_amd64-sysroot/usr/include/string.h:28:1: error: expected member name or ';' after declaration specifiers
   28 | __BEGIN_DECLS

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter is adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in a header file. But this header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition.

## Solution
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Note

*   Redefinition of 'size_t'
*   Missing '}' at end of definition of 'gpu::gles2::GLES2Interface'
*   Unknown type name 'size_t'
*   No template named '__libcpp_is_trivially_equality_comparable'
*   Use of undeclared identifier '__libcpp_is_constant_evaluated'
*   No member named 'addressof' in namespace 'gpu::gles2::std'
*   No template named '__copy_cv_t'
*   Use of undeclared identifier 'remove_cv_t'
*   No member named '__invoke' in namespace 'gpu::gles2::std'
