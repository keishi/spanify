# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1432

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `std::distance` function returns a signed `long` value, but the `subspan` method requires an unsigned size. The rewriter did not insert a cast to `size_t` to safely convert the potentially negative `long` value returned by `std::distance` to an unsigned type.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to insert a `static_cast<size_t>` or `base::checked_cast<size_t>` to cast the argument of subspan() from a signed value to an unsigned value.

For example:
```c++
-   auto range = base::span(units_).subspan(range_start, range_end - range_start);
+   auto range = base::span(units_).subspan(range_start, static_cast<size_t>(range_end - range_start));
```

## Note

Multiple other errors arise from incorrect handling of `base::span` after spanification. Specifically, `GetMappingUnitForPosition` is expected to return `OffsetMappingUnit*`, but was changed to return `base::span<OffsetMappingUnit>`, leading to subsequent code expecting pointer members instead of `base::span` objects. In addition to that there were equality comparators that were broken when passing the span as argument.
```c++

```
These errors could be grouped into one or more of the following categories:

*   Rewriter needs to add .data() to spanified return value.
*   Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.
