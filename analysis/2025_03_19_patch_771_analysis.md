# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_771

## First error
../../chrome/browser/icon_transcoder/svg_icon_transcoder.cc:110:41: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
  110 |   GURL data_url(kSvgDataUrlPrefix.data().subspan(base64_svg));
      |                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The replacements for ".data()" and ".subspan()" are conflicting and placed in the wrong place. The diff shows that the rewriter arrayified `kSvgDataUrlPrefix` and then chain called .data().subspan(). data() returns a `base::span` and therefore can't be used like that.

## Solution
Instead of calling `.data().subspan()` to construct `GURL` with `kSvgDataUrlPrefix`, call the constructor with `.begin()` or just use the whole `kSvgDataUrlPrefix` variable.
But the real problem is that these chain calls don't make sense here. The rewriter should only use subspan on the original char[].

## Note
None
