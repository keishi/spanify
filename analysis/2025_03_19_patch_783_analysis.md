# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_783

## First error

../../components/headless/screen_info/headless_screen_info.cc:173:40: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The rewriter attempts to apply both `.data()` and `.subspan()` to `kUnknownScreenInfoParam` without proper handling of the combined usage. The code attempts to call `.subspan()` on `kUnknownScreenInfoParam.data()`, but this results in the syntax error, as .data() returns a `char*`, and the code expects a span-like object for the `subspan` method call.

## Solution
The rewriter should generate the correct syntax. The goal of this change is to rewrite `kUnknownScreenInfoParam + std::string(key)` as `kUnknownScreenInfoParam.data().subspan(std::string(key))`. So the rewriter needs to rewrite the expression to construct the span. The correct code is: `return std::string(kUnknownScreenInfoParam.data(), kUnknownScreenInfoParam.size()).subspan(0, key.size());`. Another solution is to use `absl::string_view` which is implicitely constructible from `char*`: `return absl::string_view(kUnknownScreenInfoParam.data(), kUnknownScreenInfoParam.size()).substr(0, key.size()).ToString();`. The substr() will create a copy here and toString() copy from the `absl::string_view`.

## Note
There are other errors due to this replacement so focusing on fixing the root issue is important.
