## First error

../../base/threading/thread_local_storage.cc:372:15: error: no matching function for call to 'begin'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid adding .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The rewriter arrayified `slot_destruction_order` but incorrectly added `.data()` to the `std::begin` and `std::end` function calls. The standard library algorithms like `std::sort` expect iterators, not raw pointers. Since the variable is already a `std::array`, there is no need to call `.data()`.

## Solution
The rewriter should not be modifying existing code that doesn't involve spanification or arrayification.

## Note
The second error is similar, for `std::end`. The diff shows only the `.data()` being added, and nothing removed, so this is likely an unrelated code modification instead of a rewrite conflict.
