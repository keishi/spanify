# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_908

## First error

../../media/muxers/mp4_muxer_box_writer_unittest.cc:1010:43: error: no viable conversion from 'const unsigned int *' to 'base::span<const unsigned int>'
 1010 |       for (base::span<const unsigned int> iter = std::begin(kSampleDurations);
      |                                           ^      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The code attempts to initialize a `base::span` named `iter` with `std::begin(kSampleDurations)`. `std::begin` returns a raw pointer. There is no implicit conversion from raw pointer to span and the code fails to compile.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to avoid this pattern.

## Note
The second error is:
`../../media/muxers/mp4_muxer_box_writer_unittest.cc:1011:48: error: cannot increment value of type 'base::span<const unsigned int>'` which was caused by failing to initialize the span correctly.
