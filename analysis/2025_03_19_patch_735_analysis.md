# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_735

## First error

Conflicting replacement text: ./media/base/container_names_unittest.cc at offset 906, length 14: "(kRm2Buffer.size() * sizeof(decltype(kRm2Buffer)::value_type))" != "(kWtvBuffer.size() * sizeof(decltype(kWtvBuffer)::value_type))"

## Category
Overlapping replacements in macro.

## Reason
The error indicates that there are conflicting replacement texts at the same offset in `media/base/container_names_unittest.cc`. This is likely due to overlapping replacements generated inside a macro that is used in multiple places. The rewriter is generating multiple replacements for the same code region, but with different content.

## Solution
The rewriter should be modified to handle macro expansions correctly, likely by detecting that a region is within a macro and only generating one replacement for that region. The error message provides the conflicting text, offset, and filename.

## Note
The error message contains many similar conflicts, all occurring within the same file and at the same offset. This reinforces the hypothesis that the problem is related to a macro being used multiple times.
