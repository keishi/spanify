# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1280

## First error

../../ui/gfx/render_text_unittest.cc:1221:30: error: no viable conversion from 'const uint32_t *' (aka 'const unsigned int *') to 'base::span<const uint32_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned int>')

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the constructor of `TestRectangleBuffer` class:
```c++
TestRectangleBuffer(const char* string,
-                      const SkColor* buffer,
+                      base::span<const SkColor> buffer,
                       uint32_t stride,
                       uint32_t row_count)
       : string_(string),
-        buffer_(buffer),
+        buffer_(buffer),
         stride_(stride),
         row_count_(row_count) {}
```
but failed to update the call sites of `TestRectangleBuffer`. The code is passing a raw pointer `bitmap.getPixels()` to the spanified function.

## Solution
The rewriter failed to update the call site because it couldn't deduce the size of the raw pointer, or failed to consider the raw pointer from getPixels() to be size information unavailable. It should insert `{static_cast<const uint32_t*>(bitmap.getPixels()), height * width}` to construct the span.

## Note
There are several similar errors in this patch.
