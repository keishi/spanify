# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_62

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/fonts/opentype/open_type_vertical_data.cc:281:21: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<float>' and 'float *')

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `out_xy_array` to `base::span<float>`.  In the original code, the loop increment was done using pointer arithmetic: `out_xy_array++`. After the conversion, the loop increment needs to use `.subspan()`: `out_xy_array = out_xy_array.subspan(1)`. However, the rewriter has failed to correctly apply the subspan rewrite. The code the rewriter produced was incomplete. It was attempting to use `UNSAFE_TODO` which also lead to additional syntax errors.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to properly transform `out_xy_array++` into `out_xy_array = out_xy_array.subspan(1)`.

## Note
There are multiple syntax errors because the rewriter did not fully complete the transformation.
