# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_925

## First error

../../device/bluetooth/floss/floss_adapter_client.cc:241:29: error: member reference base type 'const char[]' is not a structure or union
  241 |       kExportedCallbacksPath.data()

## Category
Rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified `kExportedCallbacksPath`, but failed to add `.data()` to it when calling `.subspan()` on it. The error message "member reference base type 'const char[]' is not a structure or union" indicates that `.data()` was called on a raw array `kExportedCallbacksPath` after spanifying it.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize the `.subspan()` call on a spanified variable and properly add `.data()` where needed.
The rewrite rule should generate `kExportedCallbacksPath.data().subspan(...)` rather than `kExportedCallbacksPath.subspan(...)`.

## Note
None
