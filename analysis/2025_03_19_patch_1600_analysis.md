# Build Failure Analysis: 15

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan` method likely expects an unsigned integer type for its arguments, but the rewriter is passing a signed integer type. The `strict_cast` is failing because the implicit conversion from signed to unsigned is not considered safe by `strict_cast`.
The error occurs when calling `buffer_ptr_.subspan(bytes)` in `TestDataStream::Consume`. The `bytes` variable is of type `int`, but the `subspan` function expects an unsigned value.

## Solution
The rewriter should insert a cast to `size_t` or `unsigned` when calling `subspan` with a signed integer argument.

For example:
```c++
buffer_ptr_ = buffer_ptr_.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(bytes));
```

## Note
The `base::span` implementation uses `base::internal::StrictNumeric`, which performs range validation before casting, which rejects the implicit conversion from `int` to `size_t`.
