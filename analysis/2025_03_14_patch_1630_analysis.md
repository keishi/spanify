# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1630

## First error

../../device/base/synchronization/one_writer_seqlock_unittest.cc:135:5: error: no matching function for call to 'AtomicWriterMemcpy'
  135 |     OneWriterSeqLock::AtomicWriterMemcpy(&data, &new_data, sizeof(TestData));
      |     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
../../device/base/synchronization/one_writer_seqlock.h:92:24: note: candidate template ignored: could not match 'base::span<T>' against 'TestData *'
   92 | void OneWriterSeqLock::AtomicWriterMemcpy(base::span<T> dest,

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified a function, but failed to spanify a call site.

## Solution
Need to modify the logic to spanify both the function declaration and the callsite to prevent this mismatch.

## Note
The error log shows that the function `OneWriterSeqLock::AtomicWriterMemcpy` expected a `base::span<T>` type, but the argument passed was of type `TestData *`. This indicates that the function was spanified, but the call site was not updated to use the spanified version.
