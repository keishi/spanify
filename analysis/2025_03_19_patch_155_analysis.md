# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_155

## First error

../../components/gcm_driver/crypto/message_payload_parser_unittest.cc:155:58: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>') and 'const size_t' (aka 'const unsigned long'))
  155 |   EXPECT_EQ(parser.salt(), std::string(salt.data(), salt + kSaltSize));

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The code is attempting to create a `std::string` from a `base::span`. The `base::span` is named `salt`. The rewriter spanified the `kValidMessage` and then assigned it to a span named `salt`. Now the code is trying to do pointer arithmetic on that `salt` span, which is not allowed. Instead it should be `.data() + kSaltSize`.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize this and apply the `.data()` when it sees the span being used as the start of a buffer, or in pointer arithmetic.

## Note
There are more errors in the build log related to the same root cause.
