## First error

../../components/language_detection/core/embedding_lookup.cc:201:3: error: no matching function for call to 'GetEmbedding'

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `GetEmbedding` was spanified, but the call site is passing a raw pointer instead of a `base::span`. The spanification process did not update the call site to properly construct a `base::span` from the available data.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to update the call site to construct a `base::span` from the raw pointer and size. The required size is not directly available at the call site.

## Note
The specific line in question is within a `TFLite` context. The `TFLite` library is used for machine learning inference. If the rewriter encounters such an error again, check whether the code relies on third-party functions that might need special handling.
