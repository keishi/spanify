## First error

../../base/trace_event/trace_event_unittest.cc:260:43: error: member reference type 'base::span<const JsonKeyValue>' is not a pointer; did you mean to use '.'?
  260 |   while (!key_values.empty() && key_values->key) {
      |                                 ~~~~~~~~~~^~
      |                                           .

## Category
Rewriter needs to use . instead of -> when calling methods/fields on a `base::span` object.

## Reason
The code `key_values->key` is attempting to access a member using the pointer dereference operator `->`. However, `key_values` is a `base::span` object, which should be accessed using the dot operator `.` for member access.

## Solution
Change the code from `key_values->key` to `key_values.key`. The updated line should be:
```
while (!key_values.empty() && key_values.key) {
```
This ensures that the member `key` is accessed correctly on the `base::span` object.

## Note
The compiler reports a similar error with `++key_values;`, which must be fixed as well. The rewriter needs to generate the right C++ to compile.
