# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1345

## First error

third_party/blink/renderer/core/xml/xpath_grammar_generated.h:1464:35: error: expected expression
 1464 |     const std::array<signed char, > yytable_;
      |                                   ^

## Category
Rewriter cannot get the size of forward declared array variable.

## Reason
Rewriter arrayified a variable, but couldn't determine the size because it is a forward declaration. The forward declaration looks like this: `static const signed char yytable_[];`. The rewriter doesn't know how to determine the size of this variable.

## Solution
The rewriter should skip arrayifying a variable if it cannot determine its size.

## Note
There are extra errors that stem from this initial error.
