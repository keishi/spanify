## First error

../../base/logging.cc:208:43: error: implicit conversion changes signedness: 'int' to 'size_type' (aka 'unsigned long') [-Werror,-Wsign-conversion]
  208 |     return UNSAFE_TODO(log_severity_names[severity]);
      |                               ~~~~~~~~~~ ^~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using unsafe buffer APIs where sign conversion is involved.

## Reason
The rewriter applied span to `log_severity_names`, converting it to a type that exposes size information as a `size_type` which is unsigned. Accessing `log_severity_names` with `severity`, which is signed, now causes a sign conversion warning when it implicitly converts to `size_type`.

## Solution
Cast `severity` to size_t before accessing the array.

```c++
return UNSAFE_TODO(log_severity_names[static_cast<size_t>(severity)]);
