## First error

../../base/debug/elf_reader.cc:61:10: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'const Ehdr *' (aka 'const Elf64_Ehdr *') to function return type 'const base::span<Ehdr>' (aka 'const span<Elf64_Ehdr>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The `GetElfHeader` function is changed to return `base::span<Ehdr>`, but the implementation directly returns `reinterpret_cast<const Ehdr*>(elf_mapped_base)` which is a raw pointer. There is no implicit conversion from a raw pointer to a `base::span`. The rewriter should instead construct a span from the raw pointer along with a size. In this case, it is a single element array.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the raw pointer. The code should use `base::span<Ehdr>(reinterpret_cast<const Ehdr*>(elf_mapped_base), 1)` instead of directly returning the raw pointer.

## Note
The subsequent errors in the log are a direct result of this first error. After fixing the first error, consider handling the same pattern in the function `ReadElfLibraryName`.
