# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_743

## First error

../../net/disk_cache/blockfile/stats.cc:54:12: error: member reference type 'base::span<OnDiskStats>' is not a pointer; did you mean to use '.'?
   54 |   if (stats->signature != kDiskSignature)
      |       ~~~~~^~
      |            .

## Category
Rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value.

## Reason
In the `VerifyStats` function, `stats` is a `base::span<OnDiskStats>`, not a pointer. Therefore, the code should use the `.` operator to access members. The rewriter is failing to recognize this and is using `->`. The error message indicates this issue.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be able to change `->` to `.` when accessing members of a span.

## Note
There are other errors in this build failure which indicates there are multiple different rewrite bugs in this patch. The secondary errors are a mix of failing to add .data() to spanified objects passed into memset, and failing to properly apply `.data()` to a variable assignment.
