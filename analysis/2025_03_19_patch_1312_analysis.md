## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `strict_cast` function in `base/numerics/safe_conversions.h` is used to ensure that the value being cast is within the valid range of the destination type. In this case, the code is attempting to cast the integer literal `5` to the type of the argument expected by the `subspan` method of `base::span`. However, the compiler is unable to find a suitable `strict_cast` function that can perform this conversion without potentially losing data or causing other issues. This is because the `subspan` method expects an unsigned value for the offset, and the compiler cannot guarantee that the integer literal `5` will always be representable as an unsigned value.

## Solution
Cast the value to `size_t` in `base/profiler/stack_sampling_profiler_unittest.cc` before calling `subspan`:
```c++
 std::sort(ev.data(), base::span<WaitableEvent*>(ev).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(5)).data());
```
The general fix for this, however, is to change the rewriter logic to automatically insert `static_cast<size_t>()` when calling `subspan` and the argument is a signed integer.

## Note
The issue is caused by passing a signed literal `5` to a function that expects an unsigned `size_t` parameter.
