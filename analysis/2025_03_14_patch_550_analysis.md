## First error

../../net/dns/address_sorter_posix_unittest.cc:299:10: error: cannot increment value of type 'base::span<const char *const>'
  299 |          ++addr) {
      |          ^ ~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to handle base::span with iterators correctly.

## Reason
The original code was using a C-style array, and the loop iterated by incrementing the pointer. The rewriter changed the type of the `addresses` variable to `base::span<const char* const>`. The loop condition `*addr != nullptr` is valid for spans, but the increment `++addr` is not because the span type needs to use iterators.

## Solution
Replace the C-style array loop with iterators. Replace
```c++
for (base::span<const char* const> addr = addresses; addr[0] != nullptr;
         ++addr) {
```
with
```c++
for (auto addr = addresses.begin(); addr != addresses.end() && *addr != nullptr;
         ++addr) {
```
This uses iterators instead of pointer arithmetic, which is the correct way to loop through a span.
