## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The rewriter attempts to cast a signed int to an unsigned size_t in the generated code. The `strict_cast` function used does not allow implicit casting from signed to unsigned integers to avoid possible truncation errors.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to cast the argument to `subspan()` to an unsigned value (size_t or unsigned long depending on platform) before calling `strict_cast`.

## Note
