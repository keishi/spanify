## First error

../../device/fido/cable/v2_handshake.cc:506:36: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'uint64_t *' (aka 'unsigned long *') to 'base::span<uint64_t, 1>' (aka 'span<unsigned long, 1>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified a variable but left a reinterpret_cast that is applied to it. The code is trying to create a `span` from the address of the `v` variable, but the address is already a pointer, so it doesn't need to be reinterpreted. However, this reinterpret_cast is invalid and results in a compile error.

## Solution
The rewriter should remove the `reinterpret_cast` when creating a span from a variable whose address is being taken. base::span has a constructor taking `T (&arr)[N]` as input, which is what is needed here. The following replacement of code is needed.

```c++
// Before
reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(base::span<uint64_t, 1>(&v));

// After
base::span<uint64_t, 1>(&v)
```

## Note
I used the get_chromium_file tool to confirm that the function is not third party code.
