# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1682

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan()` method of `base::span` requires an unsigned integer for the offset, but the value being passed in is a signed integer. The rewriter failed to insert the necessary cast to `size_t` or `unsigned`. This occurs in the construction of the `std::string` where `.subspan(2)` is called.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to cast the integer `2` to `size_t` when calling `subspan()` like this: `.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(2))`

## Note
The other error is that `TestSuccessNonrangeRequest` requires `std::string` as argument but `kTestFileData1` is now `std::string_view`, so the rewriter should have used `.data()` for `kTestFileData1` when calling `TestSuccessNonrangeRequest`. This is a secondary error.
