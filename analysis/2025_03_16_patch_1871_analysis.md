# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_16_patch_1871

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code is trying to implicitly convert the `index` variable (which is a signed `int`) to an unsigned type when calling `strict_cast<T>(value)`. Since strict_cast only works for signed to signed conversions, it is failing.

## Solution
The rewriter should explicitly cast the `index` variable to an unsigned type before passing it to the `subspan()` method. For example:

```c++
return schema_data_.int_enums.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(index)).data();
```

This cast makes the conversion explicit, which would allow `strict_cast` to choose the correct overload.

## Note
There are multiple errors of the same kind in the build log.
