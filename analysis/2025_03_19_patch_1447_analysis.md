# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1447

## First error

../../ui/base/resource/data_pack.cc:267:16: error: no viable overloaded '='
  267 |   alias_table_ = reinterpret_cast<const Alias*>(
      |   ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  268 |       &data[margin_to_skip + resource_table_size]);

## Category
Rewriter does not handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The rewriter is trying to assign a raw pointer to a span. The original code probably assumed that the `alias_table_` variable was a raw pointer, but the rewriter changed it to a `base::span`. The error message `no viable overloaded '='` confirms that the compiler cannot find a suitable assignment operator for assigning `const Alias*` to `base::span<const Alias, raw_ptr<const Alias, partition_alloc::internal::RawPtrTraits::kAllowPtrArithmetic>>`.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize this pattern and use `base::make_span` or construct the span with the pointer and size, since it seems like the code intends to create a span from a memory location.

## Note
The code has now changed to use `.data()` in the `bsearch` invocation, but this does not solve the underlying issue of assignment of a raw pointer to the span.
