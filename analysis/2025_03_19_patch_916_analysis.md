# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_916

## First error

../../sandbox/linux/syscall_broker/broker_simple_message_unittest.cc:254:28: error: expected expression
  254 |   return dst.subspan(sizeof)(BrokerSimpleMessage::EntryType);
      |                            ^

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value, resulting in a syntax error. It seems to apply `subspan` incorrectly. The expected code should be `return dst.subspan(sizeof(BrokerSimpleMessage::EntryType));`.

## Solution
The rewriter should correctly apply `subspan` to the spanified return value. Check for `subspan` rewrite and apply fix.

## Note
The other errors are also related to the first error where the subspan was not applied correctly. The last two errors are due to not adding `.data()` to `message_content` which is now a `std::array`. The rewriter needs to add .data() to arrayified `char[]` variable used with std::string.
