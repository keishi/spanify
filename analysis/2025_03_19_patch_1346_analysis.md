# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1346

## First error

third_party/blink/renderer/core/xml/xpath_grammar_generated.h:1459:35: error: expected expression
 1459 |     const std::array<signed char, > yydefgoto_;
      |                                   ^

## Category
Rewriter cannot get the size of forward declared array variable.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to change a C-style array to a `std::array`, but it cannot determine the size of `yydefgoto_`. The type is `signed char[]`, but the size is not specified here, and the array is declared in the class as a forward declared variable. The rewriter doesn't seem to know how to handle this case, resulting in an incomplete `std::array` declaration.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid attempting to change C-style arrays to `std::array` when the array size cannot be determined from the code in that location. It should check if the size is available before attempting the rewrite.

## Note
The rewriter should avoid including `<array>` in header files unless absolutely necessary, as this can expose system headers.
