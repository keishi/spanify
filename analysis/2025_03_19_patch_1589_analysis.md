# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1589

## First error

../../ui/events/ozone/evdev/stylus_button_event_converter_evdev_unittest.cc:124:54: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<struct input_event>' and 'long')
  124 |   int nwrite = HANDLE_EINTR(write(write_pipe_, queue + queue_index,

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The code `queue + queue_index` is attempting to perform pointer arithmetic on a `base::span`, but span does not support addition. The rewriter replaced a raw pointer with a span in the function definition, but did not rewrite the call site to account for the change. In this case, the correct fix is to use `queue.subspan(queue_index)`

## Solution
The rewriter must also update the call site to use `subspan` instead of the `+` operator. It should replace `queue + queue_index` with `queue.subspan(queue_index)`.

## Note
The error message indicates that `base::span<struct input_event>` and `long` are not compatible operands for the `+` operator. Also the `HANDLE_EINTR` macro might be obscuring other errors, but this is the first error shown.
