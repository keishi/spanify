# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_365

## First error

../../chrome/browser/devtools/device/usb/android_usb_device.cc:58:33: error: cannot cast from type 'const std::string' (aka 'const basic_string<char>') to pointer type 'unsigned char *'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter is casting a `std::string` directly to `base::span<unsigned char>`. This is invalid C++ because you cannot cast a `std::string` to a `span`. It should be casting `data.data()` to `base::span<unsigned char>`.

## Solution
Rewrite the code as follows

```c++
 base::span<unsigned char> x =
      base::span<unsigned char>(reinterpret_cast<unsigned char*>(data.data()), data.length());
```

## Note
There is a second error in the log.

```
../../chrome/browser/devtools/device/usb/android_usb_device.cc:62:14: error: cannot increment value of type 'base::span<unsigned char>'
   62 |     sum += (x++)[0];
      |             ~^
```

This error is secondary to the first error. The rewriter changed a raw pointer `x` to a `span x`, but didn't update the `x++` operation. The rewriter should rewrite this to `x = x.subspan(1)` or `++it` if an iterator was used.
