# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1350

## First error
```
third_party/blink/renderer/core/xml/xpath_grammar_generated.h:1473:35: error: expected expression
 1473 |     const std::array<signed char, > yyr1_;
      |                                   ^
```

## Category
Rewriter cannot get the size of forward declared array variable.

## Reason
The rewriter is trying to convert `signed char yyr1_[]` to `std::array`. But the size of the array is not known because it is declared as `signed char yyr1_[]`. The rewriter cannot determine the size of `yyr1_` because it is not defined in the header file.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid arrayifying variables if it cannot determine the size of the array. This can occur with forward declarations or incomplete types.
