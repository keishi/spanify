## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter is adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in a header file. But this header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in header files. Instead, it should forward declare `base::span` and include the header file in the `.cc` file.

## Note
The include is happening in `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_autogen.h` which is an autogenerated file. This means that the rewriter is including span in a autogenerated header file. The rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.
