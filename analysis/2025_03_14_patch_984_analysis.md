# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_984

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webaudio/periodic_wave.cc:312:41: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from '__m128i *' to 'base::span<__m128i, 1>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to handle address of a spanified variable passed into a function.

## Reason
The code attempts to create a `base::span` from the address of a local variable `v_index2` using a functional-style cast. However, the constructor of `base::span` doesn't directly accept a raw pointer in this way (especially a pointer to an `__m128i` variable). This is because `v_index2` is a variable, and the address of a variable is not a valid range. The rewriter is not generating correct code to handle this case.

## Solution
The rewriter should create a temporary `base::span` object from `v_index2` and pass this new object instead of `&v_index2`. To construct a span from a single variable, you can use `base::span_from_ref`. The corrected line will then be `base::span_from_ref(v_index2)`. If this is not what was intended, the size of the span can be also be specified by using the designated initalizer `{&v_index2, size}` if more than one element is intended.

For example, the original code:

```c++
base::span<const unsigned int> range_index2 =
      reinterpret_cast<const unsigned*>(base::span<__m128i, 1>(&v_index2));
```

should be modified to:

```c++
base::span<const unsigned int> range_index2 =
      reinterpret_cast<const unsigned*>(base::span_from_ref(v_index2));
```

or if a span with the size of 4 was intended:
```c++
base::span<const unsigned int> range_index2 =
      reinterpret_cast<const unsigned*>(base::span{&v_index2, 4});
```

## Note
The secondary error is a consequence of the first error, and the fix should address both errors.
