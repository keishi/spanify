# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1017

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:496:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span when iterating over C-style arrays.

## Reason
The original code used iterators to loop through a C-style array:
```c++
for (auto* it = std::begin(kMissingRequiredFieldsTestProviders);
     it != std::end(kMissingRequiredFieldsTestProviders); ++it)
```

The rewriter then tried to change the type of `it` to be `base::span`, like this:
```c++
for (base::span<policy::TestProvider> it =
         std::begin(kMissingRequiredFieldsTestProviders);
     it != std::end(kMissingRequiredFieldsTestProviders); ++it)
```

`std::begin` and `std::end` return raw pointers for C-style arrays, but base::span does not have a constructor that takes raw pointers.
Instead, the base::span needs to be directly constructed from the C-style array.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize this pattern and generate code to construct a base::span from the C-style array:
```c++
for (base::span<policy::TestProvider> it = base::make_span(kMissingRequiredFieldsTestProviders);
     it != std::end(kMissingRequiredFieldsTestProviders); ++it)
```

or, it's even better to rewrite to this:
```c++
for (auto& it : kMissingRequiredFieldsTestProviders)
```

## Note
The second error in the log is:
../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:498:61: error: cannot increment value of type 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'
  498 |        it != std::end(kMissingRequiredFieldsTestProviders); ++it)

This error is caused by not being able to increment a span (the for loop is using span as an iterator).
