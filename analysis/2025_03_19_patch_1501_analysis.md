# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1501

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h:2259:42: error: no viable conversion from 'const volatile GLenum *' (aka 'const volatile unsigned int *') to 'base::span<const volatile GLenum>' (aka 'span<const volatile unsigned int>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified `DoInvalidateFramebuffer` in `gles2_cmd_decoder.cc`, but failed to recognize that the call sites in `gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h` should not be touched because autogen headers should be excluded from rewriting.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code. Ideally we should also have a compile error if a file excluded by the rewriter includes span.h.

## Note
This error occurs in gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h which is generated code, so it is excluded from the rewriter. Thus we shouldn't spanify functions that require rewriting excluded code. There are several other errors in autogenerated code.
