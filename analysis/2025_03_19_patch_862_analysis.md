# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_862

## First error

../../build/linux/debian_bullseye_amd64-sysroot/usr/include/string.h:28:1: error: expected member name or ';' after declaration specifiers
  28 | __BEGIN_DECLS
      | ^~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter is adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in a header file (`gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_autogen.h`). But this header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition because `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface.h` is including `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_autogen.h` inside `namespace gpu { namespace gles2 { class GLES2Interface {`

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid including `base/containers/span.h` inside a class declaration if it causes system headers to be transitively included, and if those system headers wrap their contents in `extern "C" {}`. The rewriter should probably not be modifying generated files in general.

## Note
The other errors are a result of the first error which causes redefinition of `size_t` and missing '}' at the end of definition of `gpu::gles2::GLES2Interface`.
