## First error

../../base/threading/scoped_blocking_call_internal.cc:287:31: error: implicit conversion changes signedness: 'int' to 'size_type' (aka 'unsigned long') [-Werror,-Wsign-conversion]
  287 |       ++intervals_jank_count_[i];
      |         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid sign conversion when accessing std::array.

## Reason
The variable `i` is implicitly converted from `int` to `size_t` (aka `unsigned long`) when accessing `intervals_jank_count_[i]`. This sign conversion is not safe, since `i` may be negative. This is not allowed with `-Werror,-Wsign-conversion`. The original code using `size_t intervals_jank_count_[kNumIntervals]` didn't have this warning, probably because the type of loop variable is usually size_t to begin with.

## Solution
The rewriter should use `size_t` for the loop variable instead of `int`.
```c++
-    for (int i = 0; i < kNumIntervals; ++i) {
+    for (size_t i = 0; i < kNumIntervals; ++i) {
```

## Note
The original code used a C-style array, so the compiler assumed that `i` and `kNumIntervals` are size_t. But after rewriting it to std::array, the compiler warns that signedness changes when converting from int to size_t.
