# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_215

## First error

Overlapping replacements: ./components/feedback/redaction_tool/ip_address.h at offset 2045, length 8: "" and offset 2047, length 0: "*"

## Category
Overlapping replacements between EraseMemberCall and EraseMemberCall.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to insert `base::span<uint8_t>` at the `begin()` method's return type in ip_address.h. At the same time, it is adding `.data()` to calls to `begin()` in ip_address.cc. This causes a conflict because the rewriter is trying to replace the same code range with different text. It seems the replacements are interfering with each other because the rewriter is trying to replace "" with "base::span<uint8_t>" and "*" with "" at overlapping locations.

## Solution
The rewriter should detect that `begin()` is being spanified, so it should avoid adding `.data()` to any calls to it.

## Note
The diff shows the following changes:
```
-  const uint8_t* begin() const { return data(); }
+  const base::span<uint8_t> begin() const { return *data(); }
```
This is what caused the errors.
Also, the following changes are not correct because data() returns a span, and subspan() should be applied to the span, not .data().
```
bytes.insert(bytes.end(),
-               address.bytes().begin() + std::size(kIPv4MappedPrefix),
+               address.bytes().begin() .subspan( std::size(kIPv4MappedPrefix)).data(),
                address.bytes().end());
```
This error could be addressed in a separate bug.
```
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.
