# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1671

## First error

../../build/linux/debian_bullseye_amd64-sysroot/usr/include/string.h:28:1: error: expected member name or ';' after declaration specifiers

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter is adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in a header file (gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_autogen.h). But this header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition in gles2_interface.h.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to avoid adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` inside the header file because it causes an issue in the autogenerated files. Only source files (.cc) should include `base/containers/span.h`.

## Note
There are other errors related to redefinition of size_t and expected member name which are consequences of the first error.
