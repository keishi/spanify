# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_770

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan()` method requires an unsigned integer. The loop variable `i` is signed, which results in a type mismatch. Rewriter must be able to cast the signed loop variable to unsigned before passing into `subspan()`.

## Solution
The rewriter must cast the argument to subspan() to an unsigned value.

```diff
-        UNSAFE_TODO({ start = start.subspan(i); });
+        UNSAFE_TODO({ start = start.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(i)); });
