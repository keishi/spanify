## First error

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan` method requires an unsigned integer, but the code was passing a signed integer expression `height * width - 1`. The rewriter should have inserted an explicit cast to `size_t` or `unsigned`.

## Solution
The rewriter should cast the argument to `subspan` to an unsigned type. For example:

```c++
dest = dest.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(height * width - 1));
```

## Note
Multiple errors related to invalid operands to binary expressions in the diff suggest issues with type conversions and arithmetic involving the span after the initial span conversion. The conflicting functions are due to the implicit comparison operators being changed after applying the code change and failing the type checking.
