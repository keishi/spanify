# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1466

## First error

../../base/metrics/histogram.cc:803:37: error: implicit conversion changes signedness: 'int' to 'size_type' (aka 'unsigned long') [-Werror,-Wsign-conversion]

## Category
Rewriter needs to preserve the original type for loop variables when iterating through spanified variables.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `descriptions_` to `base::raw_span<const DescriptionPair, AllowPtrArithmetic>`, and changed `descriptions_[i]` into `descriptions_.operator[](i)`.

However, the original code used an `int` as the loop index `i`. Since `.size()` on a span returns `size_t` (aka `unsigned long`), the rewriter needs to also change the type of `i` to `size_t` to avoid this `-Wsign-conversion` warning, or use `safe_conversions.h` to safely cast the `size_t` to int. The category is for the rewriter because it is now responsible for making this change which was not there initially.

## Solution
The rewriter should change the loop variable type to `size_t` or another unsigned integer type that can hold the maximum size of the span. Alternatively use `base::checked_cast<>` from safe_conversions.h.

Example:

```c++
-      for (int i = 0; descriptions_[i].description; ++i) {
+      for (size_t i = 0; descriptions_[i].description; ++i) {
```

## Note
There are other similar errors in the build log that would be fixed with this change.

There is also an error due to an out-of-line definition of the method:
```
../../base/metrics/histogram.cc:875:33: error: out-of-line definition of 'FactoryGetWithRangeDescription' does not match any declaration in 'base::LinearHistogram'
  875 | HistogramBase* LinearHistogram::FactoryGetWithRangeDescription(
      |                                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
../../base/metrics/histogram.h:339:19: note: LinearHistogram defined here
  339 | class BASE_EXPORT LinearHistogram : public Histogram {
      |                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

This appears because the definition of the member has a different type than what is declared in the header:
```c++
--- a/base/metrics/histogram.cc
+++ b/base/metrics/histogram.cc
@@ -871,7 +871,7 @@
     Sample32 minimum,
     Sample32 maximum,

+    int32_t flags,
     const DescriptionPair descriptions[]) {
   // Originally, histograms were required to have at least one sample value
   // plus underflow and overflow buckets. For single-entry enumerations,
```

This should be fixed in addition to the first error. The category is the incorrect function signature after spanifying the code.
