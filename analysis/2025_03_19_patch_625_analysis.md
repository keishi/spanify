# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_625

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_implementation.cc:630:37: error: no viable conversion from 'const GLuint *' (aka 'const unsigned int *') to 'base::span<const GLuint>' (aka 'span<const unsigned int>')

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the `DeleteTransformFeedbacksHelper` function, but failed to update the call site in `GLES2Implementation::DeleteTransformFeedbacksHelper`. It is passing a raw pointer `transformfeedbacks` where a `base::span<const GLuint>` is expected. The compiler is unable to find a viable conversion from `const GLuint*` to `base::span<const GLuint>`.

## Solution
The rewriter should correctly handle the raw pointer to span conversion at the call site. It needs to construct a `base::span` from the raw pointer `transformfeedbacks` and the size `n`. The corrected code should look like this:

```c++
helper_->DeleteTransformFeedbacksImmediate(n, base::span(transformfeedbacks, n));
```

## Note
The same issue exists in other function calls, where the function was spanified but the call sites were not correctly updated, so this likely needs to be solved more generally.
