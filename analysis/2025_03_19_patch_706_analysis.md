## First error

../../chrome/browser/support_tool/screenshot_data_collector.cc:104:24: error: no viable conversion from 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<uint32_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned int>')
  104 |   base::span<uint32_t> bitmap_buffer = bitmap.getAddr32(0, 0);
      |                        ^               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The rewriter is assigning the raw pointer return from third party code `SkBitmap::getAddr32()` to a converted `base::span<uint32_t>`. The rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value, but the size is hard to identify.

## Solution
Since it is hard to automatically deduce the size for the `base::span`, let's replace the rewritten code with the original code for now. The original code used a raw pointer.

   // There are `frame_bytes` bytes of real data per row in `frame`. This is not

## Note
There is another error later in the log:
```
../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      |                                           ^
```

This error is caused by the rewriter using the `subspan` method on `bitmap_buffer`. But since the first fix makes bitmap_buffer a raw pointer, this error will go away as well.
