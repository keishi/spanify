# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_16_patch_1074

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/audio/cpu/x86/vector_math_impl.h:390:38: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'MType *' (aka '__m128 *') to 'base::span<MType, 1>' (aka 'span<__m128, 1>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The rewriter attempts to create a `base::span` using `base::span<MType, 1>(&m_sum)`. However, the `&m_sum` expression results in a pointer of type `MType*` (aka `__m128*`), and there is no implicit conversion to `base::span<MType, 1>`. Furthermore, the subsequent `reinterpret_cast` attempts to convert a `base::span<MType, 1>` to `const float*`, which is invalid. This is because `m_sum` is a packed float but the `span` constructor expected an array.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize the need to construct a `base::span` and generate the appropriate code to create it from a pointer and a size, adding `.data()` to handle the conversion from std::array to a pointer. Note the span is only to a single element, so `.data()` will not help. The return value is a packed float, so the pointer and size will be known. Replace the packed data with a struct so the span is a true array and can compile, or use a different approach such as a raw pointer.

The rewrite would look like:

```c++
  base::span<const MType, 1> sums(&m_sum);
  for (unsigned i = 0u; i < kPackedFloatsPerRegister; ++i)
    *sum_p += reinterpret_cast<const float*>(sums.data())[i];
```
or
```c++
  const float* sums = reinterpret_cast<const float*>(&m_sum);
  for (unsigned i = 0u; i < kPackedFloatsPerRegister; ++i)
    *sum_p += sums[i];
```

## Note
A second error occurred immediately after the first:

```
../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/audio/cpu/x86/vector_math_impl.h:390:7: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<MType, 1>' (aka 'span<__m128, 1>') to 'const float *' is not allowed
  390 |       reinterpret_cast<const float*>(base::span<MType, 1>(&m_sum));

```
This error is a direct result of the first, and a fix will likely resolve both.
