## First error

../../storage/common/file_system/file_system_util.cc:30:24: error: redefinition of 'kPersistentDir' with a different type: 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') vs 'const char[]'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid redefining variables.

## Reason
The rewriter introduced a redefinition of the variable `kPersistentDir`. The original definition was `const char kPersistentDir[] = "/persistent";` in the header file. The rewriter then added `const std::string_view kPersistentDir = "/persistent";` in the cc file. This is invalid C++ and causes a compilation error.

## Solution
The rewriter should not attempt to redefine variables that are already defined. In this specific case, it should use the existing `kPersistentDir` and avoid introducing a new definition. Check existing definition in a header or other source files.

## Note
The other errors are due to the above errors.
