## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The rewriter has introduced `base::span` to replace raw pointers. However, the arguments to `subspan()` method must be `size_t`, which is an unsigned type. In the original code, `kTracksSizeOffset` was likely an `int`, and implicit conversion from int to size_t was allowed. But after the rewrite, an explicit `strict_cast` is needed to convert the signed integer to an unsigned integer, and it failed.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to insert an explicit `static_cast<size_t>()` cast when passing arguments to `subspan()` calls.

## Note
The error message `no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'` indicates a failure in the implicit conversion during span's construction.
