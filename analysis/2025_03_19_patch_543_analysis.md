# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_543

## First error

../../base/trace_event/trace_arguments.h:687:56: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'const std::array<const char *, kMaxSize>' to function return type 'const base::span<char *const>'

## Category
Rewriter failed to handle `std::array` of const `char*` implicitly converting to `base::span` of `char*`.

## Reason
The code attempts to return a `const std::array<const char*, kMaxSize>` as a `const base::span<char* const>`. While the element types are convertible (const char* converts to char*), the array itself is const, preventing the implicit construction of the `span`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to make a copy of the `std::array` to a temporary `std::array` of `char*`, or to use `const base::span<const char* const>` as return type. Changing the return type is the preferred way.

## Note
No additional errors.
