# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_643

## First error

../../mojo/public/cpp/system/tests/wait_set_unittest.cc:216:17: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'MojoResult *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<MojoResult, 1>' (aka 'span<unsigned int, 1>')
  216 |                 base::span<MojoResult, 1>(&ready_result));
      |                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The rewriter converted WaitSet::Wait to take `base::span<MojoResult>`, but did not update the callsite in the unit test to correctly create a span from the `&ready_result`. The correct code should be `base::span<MojoResult>(&ready_result, 1)`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to update call sites of spanified functions in unit tests to pass `base::span` correctly using the two parameter constructor. In this particular case, an array was passed into the spanified function, and it should have been rewritten as the following:

```c++
base::span<MojoResult, 1>(&ready_result)
```

## Note
There were multiple instances of the same error throughout the file.
