# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1062

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:653:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'

## Category
Rewriter doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The code attempts to initialize a `base::span` with `std::begin` and `std::end` of a C-style array. The rewriter doesn't correctly handle the conversion from the iterators returned by `std::begin` and `std::end` to a `base::span`. The error indicates that there's no viable constructor for `base::span` that accepts a raw pointer (`policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *`) directly.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate the appropriate code to construct the span from the beginning and end iterators or use the size of array.
```c++
  for (base::span<policy::TestProvider> it = base::make_span(kShortcutWithSpacesTestProviders);
```

## Note
Multiple compilation errors occurred due to the incorrect span initialization and usage.
