# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1343

## First error

third_party/blink/renderer/core/xml/xpath_grammar_generated.h:1456:35: error: expected expression
 1456 |     const std::array<signed char, > yypgoto_;
      |                                   ^

## Category
Rewriter cannot get the size of forward declared array variable.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to convert a C-style array to `std::array`, but it's unable to determine the size of the array because it's a forward declaration without a known size. The error message indicates that the size of the `std::array` is missing, resulting in a syntax error.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid converting forward-declared arrays to `std::array` when the size isn't available in the current context. It needs to identify these situations and skip the rewrite or handle them differently (e.g., by attempting to determine the size in a later compilation stage or by using a `base::span` instead if size cannot be determined).

## Note
The relevant code snippet is:
```c++
     // YYPGOTO[NTERM-NUM].
-    static const signed char yypgoto_[];
+    const std::array<signed char, > yypgoto_;
```
The rewriter replaces `static const signed char yypgoto_[];` with `const std::array<signed char, > yypgoto_;`. But since the size of the array is not known, it is left empty `std::array<signed char, >`.
