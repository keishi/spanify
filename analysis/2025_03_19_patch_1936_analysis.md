# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1936

## First error

../../storage/common/file_system/file_system_util.cc:31:24: error: redefinition of 'kTemporaryDir' with a different type: 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') vs 'const char[]'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying variables that are also defined elsewhere.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to change the type of kTemporaryDir from a `char[]` to a `std::string_view`. However, `kTemporaryDir` is also declared in a header file (`file_system_util.h`) with the original type.  This leads to a redefinition error. The rewriter should not attempt to rewrite the type if there is a conflicting definition.

## Solution
The rewriter should check if a variable is declared in multiple files before attempting to rewrite its type. If the variable has an external declaration (declared in a header file), avoid rewriting it.

## Note
Several errors occurred because of this redefinition.
