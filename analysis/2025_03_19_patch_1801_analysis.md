## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/service/command_buffer_service.h:151:7: error: no viable conversion from 'std::nullptr_t' to 'base::raw_span<volatile CommandBufferEntry, AllowPtrArithmetic>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to nullptr initialization of spanified member field to {}.

## Reason
The rewriter converted a pointer field to a `base::raw_span`. However, it failed to update the initialization of that field to be `{}` instead of `nullptr`.  The error message "no viable conversion from 'std::nullptr_t' to 'base::raw_span...'" indicates that the compiler is trying to assign `nullptr` to a `base::raw_span`, which is not allowed. `base::raw_span` should be initialized with `{}` instead.

## Solution
The rewriter must be updated to change all occurrences of `= nullptr` to `= {}` during spanification of member fields.

## Note
The diff snippet shows that the member field `buffer_` was correctly converted to `base::raw_span`:

```
-  raw_ptr<volatile CommandBufferEntry, AllowPtrArithmetic> buffer_ = nullptr;
+  base::raw_span<volatile CommandBufferEntry, AllowPtrArithmetic> buffer_ =
+      nullptr;
```

However, the rewriter failed to convert `nullptr` to `{}`.
