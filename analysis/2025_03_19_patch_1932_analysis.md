      |                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The rewriter is trying to call `.subspan()` on the return value of `.data()`. However, the return value of `.data()` is a `char*`, which does not have a `.subspan()` method. The correct order of operations is to use `.subspan()` on the `std::array` and then call `.data()` on the resulting span. The rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Solution
The rewriter logic needs to be changed to correctly handle the combination of `.data()` and `.subspan()`. Ensure that `.subspan()` is placed on the `std::array` before calling `.data()`.

## Note
The original code is:

```c++
? GURL(kPlayStoreAppPrefix + facet_uri.android_package_name())
```

The spanified code is:

```c++
? GURL(kPlayStoreAppPrefix.data().subspan(
                             facet_uri.android_package_name()))
