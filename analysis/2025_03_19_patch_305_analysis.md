# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_305

## First error

../../sandbox/linux/suid/common/suid_unsafe_environment_variables.h:5:10: fatal error: 'array' file not found

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter added `#include <array>` in a header file, `suid_unsafe_environment_variables.h`, but this header is being included by a C file (`sandbox.c`). Since the C file is compiled as C, it cannot include the C++ header `<array>`.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid adding `#include <array>` if the header file it is modifying is ever included by a C file. It can check the file type by looking at the command line arguments.

Here is how the rewriter logic could be changed:
1. In the clang tool, access the FrontendOptions.
2. Check if any of the Inputs have a file kind of C.
3. If so, do not add #include <array> in the header.

Alternatively, the generated header should be a .h file (C++ header) and not a .c file.

## Note
The error happens in `../../sandbox/linux/suid/sandbox.c`, which is a C file. The header file `suid_unsafe_environment_variables.h` is being included by the C file.
