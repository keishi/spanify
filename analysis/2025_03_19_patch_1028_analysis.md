# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1028

## First error

../../ui/gfx/geometry/matrix44.h:52:18: error: suggest braces around initialization of subobject [-Werror,-Wmissing-braces]
   52 |       : matrix_{{1, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 1}} {}
      |                  ^~~~~~~~~~
      |                  {         }

## Category
Rewriter introduced syntax errors due to incorrect initialization of std::array.

## Reason
The rewriter changed `double matrix_[4][4]` to `std::array<std::array<double, 4>, 4> matrix_;`. The initialization syntax used in the constructor initializer list is not correct for `std::array`.  The compiler suggests adding extra braces, indicating it's interpreting the provided initializer list in an unexpected way.

## Solution
The rewriter should generate correct initialization syntax for `std::array`.  Specifically, the diff should use assignment initialization as follows:

```c++
Matrix44() : matrix_ {{1, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 1}} {}
```

## Note
The build failure also indicates excess elements in struct initializers and no matching function for `LoadDouble4` and `StoreDouble4`.
These errors are likely a consequence of the incorrect initialization. LoadDouble4 and StoreDouble4 use C-style array syntax which no longer compiles when the member is std::array.
