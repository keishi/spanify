# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_707

## First error

../../chrome/browser/ui/chrome_pages.cc:711:48: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
  711 |       chrome::kChromeUIWebAppSettingsURL.data().subspan(app_id));
      |       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The rewriter added `.data()` on `chrome::kChromeUIWebAppSettingsURL`, but then it also tried to apply `.subspan()` on it. This resulted in the code `chrome::kChromeUIWebAppSettingsURL.data().subspan(app_id)` which is invalid because you can't call `.subspan()` on a `char*`. The `.subspan()` is being added to a string literal which is then used to initialize a GURL object.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be smarter about when to add `.data()` and `.subspan()`. Either the ".data()" should not be added here, or the ".subspan()" needs to be rewritten to accommodate the .data().

## Note
The ".data().subspan()" issue appears in the following files:
