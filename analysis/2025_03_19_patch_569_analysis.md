# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_569

## First error

../../mojo/public/cpp/bindings/tests/validation_test_input_parser.cc:136:66: error: 'DataType' is a private member of 'mojo::test::(anonymous namespace)::ValidationTestInputParser'
  136 | const auto kDataTypes = std::to_array<ValidationTestInputParser::DataType>(
      |                                                                  ^

## Category
Rewriter needs to make struct declaration public in order for std::to_array to work.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to use `std::to_array` to create a `std::array` from the `kDataTypes` array. However, `DataType` is a private member of the `ValidationTestInputParser` class.  `std::to_array` requires access to the element type, but the rewriter isn't considering the access restrictions when generating the code.

## Solution
The rewriter should ensure that the `DataType` struct is public before using `std::to_array`. Ideally this would be implemented by simply marking `DataType` as public.

## Note
The other errors are similar, stemming from the fact that the methods `ParseUnsignedInteger`, `ParseSignedInteger`, `ParseBinarySequence`, `ParseFloat`, `ParseDouble`, `ParseDistance`, `ParseAnchor`, and `ParseHandles` are all private members, but are being referenced in the re-written code. Ideally these methods also need to be made public for the code to work.

Additionally, the size calculation for `kDataTypeCount` is now incorrect. The rewriter needs to fix that as well by converting that to `.size()`.
