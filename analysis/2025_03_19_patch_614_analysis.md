# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_614

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webaudio/periodic_wave.cc:312:11: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'const __m128i *' to 'base::span<const __m128i, 1>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter has spanified a variable but left a reinterpret_cast that is applied to it. The span constructor does not accept a `const __m128i*`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be able to remove the reinterpret_cast and construct the span directly from `v_index1`.

## Note
The second error is:
```
../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webaudio/periodic_wave.cc:311:7: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<const __m128i, 1>' to 'const unsigned int *' is not allowed
```
The rewriter also introduced another error by leaving a `reinterpret_cast` of the new span type to `const unsigned int*`, which is not allowed. This should also be removed by the rewriter.
