# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1310

## First error
../../base/containers/span.h:946:33: error: cannot form a reference to 'void'
  946 |   using reference = element_type&;
      |                                 ^

## Category
Rewriter introduced invalid `base::span<void>` type.

## Reason
The rewriter converted the return type of `GuardedPageAllocator::Allocate` to `base::span<void>`. This is invalid because `base::span<T>` requires `T` to be a complete type, and `void` is an incomplete type that cannot be referenced. The rewriter failed to properly handle `void*` being converted to `base::span`.

## Solution
The rewriter should not attempt to convert void* to base::span<void>. The rewriter should check whether `element_type` of `base::span` is `void`. If so, the rewriter should avoid rewriting the code.

## Note
Multiple errors occurred.
