# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_288

## First error

../../device/bluetooth/dbus/fake_bluetooth_gatt_characteristic_client.cc:623:11: error: declaration of anonymous struct must be a definition
  623 |           struct(unnamed struct at / usr / local / google / home / nuskos /
      |           ^

## Category
Rewriter introduced invalid syntax by attempting to specify an anonymous struct inline in a type declaration.

## Reason
The rewriter tried to cast `&value` to a `base::span`. The code generated was:
```c++
base::span<uint8_t> bytes = reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(
      base::span<
          struct(unnamed struct at / usr / local / google / home / nuskos /
                     chromium -
                 team / chromium / src / out / rewrite -
                 linux /../../ device / bluetooth / dbus /
                     fake_bluetooth_gatt_characteristic_client.cc : 588 : 3),
          1>(&value));
```
This is invalid C++ syntax. The struct keyword can only be followed by a struct name or a struct definition. 

## Solution
The rewriter should declare the type as `base::span<uint8_t>` and use the address and size.

```c++
base::span<uint8_t> bytes = base::span(reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(&value), sizeof(value));
```

## Note
There are several other errors as a consequence of the first error. The rewriter also should not be calling methods from data from raw_ptr without checking whether the data is null.
