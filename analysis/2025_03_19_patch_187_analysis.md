## First error

../../remoting/host/linux/remoting_user_session.cc:268:24: error: no viable conversion from 'char *' to 'base::span<char>'
  268 |       base::span<char> delimiter = std::strchr(*variable, '=');

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The code uses `std::strchr`, which is a C library function. The return value of `std::strchr` is a `char*`, but the rewriter is attempting to assign this raw pointer directly to a `base::span<char>`. This is causing a compilation error because there's no implicit conversion from a raw `char*` to a `base::span<char>`.

## Solution
The rewriter should generate code to explicitly construct a span from the return value of `std::strchr`. Since `std::strchr` returns a pointer to the location of `=`, the size information can be determined from the original string.

Here's how the rewriter should transform the code:

Original:
```c++
base::span<char> delimiter = std::strchr(*variable, '=');
```

Rewritten:
```c++
char* delimiter_ptr = std::strchr(*variable, '=');
base::span<char> delimiter(delimiter_ptr, delimiter_ptr ? strlen(delimiter_ptr) : 0);
```

## Note
The second error is that there are no viable overloads for `operator!=` between `base::span<char>` and `std::nullptr_t`. The rewriter should have created a `char* delimiter_ptr` as in the `solution` above. After the proposed rewrite to create a char pointer, the check should work and there would be no error.
