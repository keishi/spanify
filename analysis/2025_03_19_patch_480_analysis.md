# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_480

## First error

../../media/parsers/vp8_parser.cc:742:8: error: use of undeclared identifier 'y_mode_probs'

## Category
Rewriter failed to recognize a size info unavailable rhs value.

## Reason
The variable `y_mode_probs` is being used to determine the size of a destination buffer for a `memcpy` operation. However, the rewriter incorrectly assumed `y_mode_probs` to be in scope when it was actually a member variable. It should have used `ehdr->y_mode_probs` or `curr_entropy_hdr_.y_mode_probs` instead. This resulted in an undeclared identifier error, preventing the code from compiling. This is a specific instance of the rewriter's failure to handle member variables correctly when determining sizes.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to correctly scope the member variable being accessed and use `ehdr->y_mode_probs` or `curr_entropy_hdr_.y_mode_probs` appropriately. The rewriter should be able to resolve the size call on an array variable to its fully scoped name, if it is a member.

## Note
There were multiple other instances of the same error. The rewriter must be able to resolve all in-scope variable declarations.
