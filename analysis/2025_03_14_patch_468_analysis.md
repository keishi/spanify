# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_468

## First error

../../base/command_line.cc:45:74: error: extraneous ')' before ';'
   45 | constexpr std::array<CommandLine::CharType, 2> kSwitchValueSeparator{"="});
      |                                                                          ^

## Category
Rewriter is using system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified `kSwitchValueSeparator` to `std::array<CommandLine::CharType, 2>`, but failed to include the required header `array`. This causes a syntax error because the compiler does not know what `std::array` is.

## Solution
The rewriter must make sure to include `<array>` header in the header file if it's used. This is a header inclusion bug. The rewriter should also avoid adding system headers inside of class declarations.

## Note
The other errors are:
*   `no matching function for call to 'StrAppend'` because `base::StrAppend` is being used with `kSwitchValueSeparator` as an `std::initializer_list`. `kSwitchValueSeparator` should be converted to `.data()` for `base::StrAppend` to work.
*   `member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union`. This is because `kSwitchValueSeparator.data()` does not have subspan(). This can be fixed by converting `kSwitchValueSeparator` to a `std::string`.
