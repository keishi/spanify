# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1948

## First error

../../components/gwp_asan/client/sampling_malloc_shims_unittest.cc:227:31: error: no viable conversion from 'unsigned char *' to 'base::span<unsigned char>'

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The rewriter failed to correctly handle the conversion from a raw pointer returned by `calloc` to a `base::span<unsigned char>`. The function `GetMallocGpaForTesting().PointerIsMine` expects a `const void*`, but the rewriter did not preserve the raw pointer and instead tried to pass a span directly to the function. Additionally, there is no implicit conversion from `unsigned char *` to `base::span<unsigned char>`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to either:

1.  Spanify the `PointerIsMine` function to accept `base::span` instead of `void*`.
2.  Insert `.data()` when passing a span to a function expecting a `void*` for a complete conversion.

## Note
The second error is related to the first. The rewriter converted alloc to a span, but `free` expects a `void*`. The rewriter should have added `.data()` when spanifying.
