## First error

../../net/base/chunked_upload_data_stream_unittest.cc:67:21: error: no matching function for call to 'byte_span_from_cstring'

## Category
Rewriter needs to handle array types for `byte_span_from_cstring`.

## Reason
The spanification converted `kTestData` from `char[]` to `std::array<char, 11>`.
The `byte_span_from_cstring` function expects a `char[]` but is receiving a `std::array<char, 11>`. The error message indicates there is no matching function.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to either avoid rewriting `kTestData` or it needs to modify the call sites of `byte_span_from_cstring` to correctly handle `std::array`. The best solution would be to add an overload for `byte_span_from_cstring` that accepts a `std::array`. The function should call `.data()` on the `std::array` to get a pointer to the underlying data. It would also need to use the `.size()` method of `std::array` to compute the size.
Also add .data to kTestData in EXPECT_EQ

## Note
This fix will likely be needed in other places as well.
