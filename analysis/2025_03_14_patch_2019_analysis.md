# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_2019

## First error

../../chrome/browser/autocomplete/search_provider_unittest.cc:2410:11: error: suggest braces around initialization of subobject [-Werror,-Wmissing-braces]
 2410 |       { { "a.com",   AutocompleteMatchType::SEARCH_WHAT_YOU_TYPED, true },

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate correct initialization code for `std::array` when replacing a C-style array.

## Reason
The rewriter replaced a C-style array with `std::array`, but failed to properly generate the braced initialization. The original code used a simplified initialization syntax suitable for C-style arrays of structs, which is invalid for `std::array`. The compiler is suggesting braces around the initialization of subobjects.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to adjust the initialization code to use the correct syntax for `std::array`. This likely involves adding an extra set of braces around each element in the initializer list.

For the given error, the solution would look like this:

```c++
  { { "a.com",   AutocompleteMatchType::SEARCH_WHAT_YOU_TYPED, true } }, // Added braces around this line
```

The rewriter must analyze and transform the initialization list to match the expected `std::array` syntax.

## Note
The build log shows several similar errors, indicating a systematic problem in how the rewriter handles struct initialization of `std::array`.
