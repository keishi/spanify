## First error

../../net/ntlm/ntlm_buffer_writer.h:184:59: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'const std::vector<uint8_t>' (aka 'const vector<unsigned char>') to function return type 'const base::span<uint8_t>' (aka 'const span<unsigned char>')
  184 |   const base::span<uint8_t> GetBufferPtr() const { return buffer_; }
      |                                                           ^~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The function `GetBufferPtr` is supposed to return a `base::span<uint8_t>`, but the rewriter is directly returning `buffer_`, which is a `std::vector<uint8_t>`. There is no automatic conversion between these two types. Rewriter should add `.data()` to `buffer_` to explicitly convert it to `uint8_t*` so that the return type is `base::span<uint8_t>`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to add `.data()` to the return statement of `GetBufferPtr`. The corrected code should be:

```c++
  const base::span<uint8_t> GetBufferPtr() const { return buffer_.data(); }
```

## Note
The other error in `ntlm_buffer_writer.cc` is likely due to an incomplete rewriting or a typo: the `if` statement has an empty conditional expression.
```c++
if () {.empty())
    return false;
  }
