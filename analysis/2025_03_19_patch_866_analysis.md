# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_866

## First error

../../build/linux/debian_bullseye_amd64-sysroot/usr/include/string.h:28:1: error: expected member name or ';' after declaration specifiers
   28 | __BEGIN_DECLS

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter is adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_autogen.h`. But this header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition (specifically the `gpu::gles2::GLES2Interface` class).

## Solution
The rewriter should not add includes inside a class definition.

## Note
The rewriter is adding the include to a generated file, `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_autogen.h`. This should be avoided (Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.) But, because it is not inside the `third_party` directory, this issue takes precedence.
