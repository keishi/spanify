# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_621

## First error

third_party/blink/renderer/core/layout/block_break_token.h:268:40: error: expected expression
  268 |   std::array<Member<const BreakToken>, > child_break_tokens_;
      |                                        ^

## Category
Rewriter needs to provide a size argument to `std::array`.

## Reason
The rewriter is creating a `std::array` but failing to specify its size. In C++ `std::array` requires a size. The `child_break_tokens_` is meant to hold `const BreakToken` objects. The size is defined by `const_num_children_`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to get the size and pass it as a template argument to `std::array`.

```c++
std::array<Member<const BreakToken>, const_num_children_> child_break_tokens_;
```

## Note
There was another error that was caused by the first error. Once the size argument is passed into `std::array`, then the second error would disappear.
