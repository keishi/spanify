# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_15_patch_1183

## First error

../../mojo/public/cpp/bindings/lib/validation_util.h:40:11: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<const uint64_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned long>') to 'uintptr_t' (aka 'unsigned long') is not allowed
   40 |          (reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(offset).subspan(static_cast) < uint32_t >
      |           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid reinterpret_cast from 'base::span' to 'uintptr_t'.

## Reason
The rewriter introduced a `reinterpret_cast` from a `base::span<const uint64_t>` to `uintptr_t`. This is not allowed and results in a compile error. The goal of the code was likely to obtain the address of the memory pointed to by the span, but `reinterpret_cast` is the wrong tool.

## Solution
Instead of using `reinterpret_cast`, the rewriter should use `base::to_address()` on the `base::span` to get the underlying pointer as `uintptr_t`. Then, access the first element of the span using `offset[0]` before conversion to `uintptr_t`.
The code should be rewritten as:
```c++
inline bool ValidateEncodedPointer(base::span<const uint64_t> offset) {
  return offset[0] <= std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max() &&
         (static_cast<uint32_t>(offset[0]) >=
          reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(base::to_address(offset)));
}
```

## Note
The build failure includes additional syntax errors on the same line. These errors seem to result from the incorrect cast and subsequent call to `.subspan`. Fixing the initial `reinterpret_cast` will likely resolve these secondary errors as well.
