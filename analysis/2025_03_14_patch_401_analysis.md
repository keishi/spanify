# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_401

## First error

../../media/cdm/aes_decryptor_unittest.cc:692:43: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') and 'decltype(__c.size())' (aka 'unsigned long'))

## Category
Rewriter needs to add .data() to arrayified `char[]` variable used with std::string.

## Reason
The code attempts to add a `std::string_view` (kOriginalData2) with an `unsigned long` (result of `std::size`). The addition operator is not defined between `std::string_view` and `unsigned long`, leading to a compilation error. This happened because the rewriter converted `kOriginalData2` from `char[]` to `std::string_view`. Since `char[]` decays into a `char*` which supports pointer arithmetic, but `std::string_view` does not, this broke the code.

## Solution
The rewriter should add `.data()` to kOriginalData2 before applying the `std::size` calculation, to correctly get a pointer which supports pointer arithmetics.

## Note
The patch also introduces `<string_view>`, which is technically part of the fix, but doesn't cause this build error.
