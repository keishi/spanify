# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_701

## First error

../../media/base/sinc_resampler.cc:141:22: error: assigning to 'ConvolveProc' (aka 'float (*)(const int, const float *, const float *, const float *, double)') from incompatible type 'float (const int, base::span<const float>, const float *, const float *, double)': type mismatch at 2nd parameter ('const float *' vs 'base::span<const float>')
  141 |     convolve_proc_ = Convolve_C;
      |                      ^~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter spanified a function, but failed to spanify a call site.

## Reason
The rewriter changed the function signature of `SincResampler::Convolve_C` to accept a `base::span<const float>` as the second argument. However, it didn't update the `convolve_proc_` member to match the new function signature. The `convolve_proc_` member is a function pointer that still expects a `const float*`, leading to a type mismatch during the assignment.

## Solution
The rewriter should identify all function pointers that are assigned a spanified function and update their signature accordingly. In this particular case, the rewriter should modify the declaration of `convolve_proc_` in the `SincResampler` class to accept a `base::span<const float>` as the second argument.

## Note
The second error occurs because the increment operator `++` is not defined for `base::span<const float>`. This happened because the rewriter spanified the function, but failed to update the local code to work with the span argument. The rewriter should be able to update the code to properly iterate through span.
