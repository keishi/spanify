# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_649

## First error

../../net/base/hash_value.h:96:58: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<unsigned char>' and 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned long'))
   96 |     return UNSAFE_BUFFERS(iterator(data().data(), data() + size()));
      |                                                   ~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the `data()` function in `HashValue`, but failed to properly rewrite the expression `data() + size()` within the `begin()` iterator. It is attempting to add a size to the span when it should be adding to the underlying data pointer. This is because the `begin()` method on `HashValue` was changed by the spanification to return a `base::span<unsigned char>::iterator`, and the subspan rewrite was not applied to the `data()` call.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to recognize the pattern where a size is being added to `data()` and apply the `.data()` call to the `data()` in order to make the pointer arithmetic correct.

```c++
return UNSAFE_BUFFERS(iterator(data().data(), data().data() + size()));
```

## Note
The same error also occurs in line 105.
