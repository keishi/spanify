# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_666

## First error

../../ui/base/l10n/formatter.cc:380:26: error: implicit conversion changes signedness: 'int' to 'size_type' (aka 'unsigned long') [-Werror,-Wsign-conversion]

## Category
Rewriter dropped mutable qualifier.

## Reason
The rewriter changed a mutable `std::unique_ptr<Formatter> formatter_[TimeFormat::FORMAT_COUNT][TimeFormat::LENGTH_COUNT];` to a non-mutable `std::array<std::array<std::unique_ptr<Formatter>, TimeFormat::LENGTH_COUNT>, TimeFormat::FORMAT_COUNT> formatter_;`.

The original code was likely written like this to allow the individual `unique_ptr`s within the array to be reset. After spanification, the mutability was dropped, causing the reset operation to fail.

## Solution
The rewriter should preserve the `mutable` qualifier when converting a C-style array to `std::array`.

```c++
// Original code:
mutable std::unique_ptr<Formatter> formatter_[TimeFormat::FORMAT_COUNT][TimeFormat::LENGTH_COUNT];

// Corrected code:
mutable std::array<std::array<std::unique_ptr<Formatter>, TimeFormat::LENGTH_COUNT>, TimeFormat::FORMAT_COUNT> formatter_;
```

## Note
There were two sign conversion errors reported. Both were from the same root cause: the rewriter dropped the `mutable` qualifier from the array declaration.
