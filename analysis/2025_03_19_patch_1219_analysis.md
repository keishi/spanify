## Category
Rewriter needs to handle std::array converted from C-style array with `base::byte_span_from_cstring`.

## Reason
The code changed `kBuffer` from a C-style array to `std::array`. `base::byte_span_from_cstring` only works with C-style arrays. The rewriter failed to recognize that `kBuffer` is now a `std::array` and didn't update the call to use the `.data()` method to access the underlying C-style array.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to add `.data()` to the `kBuffer` variable when it is passed to the `base::byte_span_from_cstring` function.

## Note
There are other errors related to this issue:
*   `no matching function for call to 'byte_span_from_cstring'` at line 417.
*   `no matching constructor for initialization of 'net::StringIOBuffer'` at line 224. This is because `net::StringIOBuffer` expects `std::string` or `char*` but it is receiving `std::array`.
