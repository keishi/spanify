# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_633

## First error

../../content/browser/content_index/content_index_database.cc:37:29: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
  37 |   return kEntryPrefix.data().subspan(id);
      |          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `kEntryPrefix` to `std::array`. The code then calls `.data()` on this array, which returns a `char*`. The rewriter then calls `.subspan()` on the `char*`. However, `.subspan()` is a member function of `base::span`, not `char*`. The rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value.

## Solution
When the rewriter spanifies `data()`, it should also change the return type of `data()` so it also returns a span, not a raw pointer.

## Note
The rewriter is also generating errors where `const std::string&` is being assigned from `const std::array<char, 21>`. It should also be generating `.data()` in these cases as well.
