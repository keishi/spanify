# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1063

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:671:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'
  671 |   for (base::span<policy::TestProvider> it =
      |                                         ^
  672 |            std::begin(kShortcutStartsWithAtTestProviders);

## Category
Rewriter doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to assign the result of `std::begin` (which is a raw pointer) to a `base::span`. However, there is no automatic conversion from a raw pointer to a `base::span` in this context because the rewriter can not deduce the size information from std::begin. The error message "no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'" clearly indicates this issue.

## Solution
The rewriter cannot currently handle this assignment, it would need a size to properly construct a span. A workaround is to use a range-based for loop instead of a manual iteration loop.

## Note
The error on line 673 is a follow-up to the failed conversion to a base::span.
