# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_492

## First error

../../chrome/browser/themes/browser_theme_pack.h:338:7: error: no viable conversion from 'std::nullptr_t' to 'base::raw_span<TintEntry, DanglingUntriaged | AllowPtrArithmetic>' (aka 'span<TintEntry, dynamic_extent, raw_ptr<TintEntry, (RawPtrTraits)9U | AllowPtrArithmetic>>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to nullptr initialization of spanified member field to {}.

## Reason
The code initializes a spanified member `tints_` with `nullptr`. The rewriter does not correctly rewrite nullptr initialization to `{}` for member fields.

```c++
  base::raw_span<TintEntry, DanglingUntriaged | AllowPtrArithmetic> tints_ =
      nullptr;
```

## Solution
The rewriter should replace `nullptr` with `{}` in member field initialization.

```c++
  base::raw_span<TintEntry, DanglingUntriaged | AllowPtrArithmetic> tints_ =
      {};
```

## Note
None
