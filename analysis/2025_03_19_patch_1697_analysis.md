## First error

../../remoting/codec/audio_encoder_opus.cc:159:7: error: reinterpret_cast from 'const std::string' (aka 'const basic_string<char>') to 'const int16_t *' (aka 'const short *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter replaced a raw pointer with a span, but retained a `reinterpret_cast` that is no longer valid with the span. Specifically, the code tries to reinterpret cast `packet->data(0)`, which is a `std::string`, to a `const int16_t*`.  The `packet->data(0)` is a `std::string` and thus cannot be directly casted to `const int16_t*`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to remove the `reinterpret_cast` and replace the call to `packet->data(0)` with `reinterpret_cast<const int16_t*>(packet->data(0).data())` to extract the underlying data pointer before casting it.

## Note
The second error occurs because the rewriter needs to cast the argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.
