## First error

../../sandbox/linux/services/libc_interceptor.cc:174:23: error: assigning to 'const char *' from incompatible type 'base::span<char>'

## Category
Rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value.

## Reason
data() was spanified, but the rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value.

```
memcpy(timezone_out.data(), timezone.data(), copy_len);
output->tm_zone = timezone_out;
```

## Solution
The rewriter must be updated to add `.data()` to `timezone_out`.
It should become

```
memcpy(timezone_out.data(), timezone.data(), copy_len);
output->tm_zone = timezone_out.data();
```

## Note
There are other errors due to similar causes. Also, there are cases where variables were not spanified when they should have been.
