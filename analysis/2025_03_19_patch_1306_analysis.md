# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1306

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webaudio/wave_shaper_handler.cc:354:15: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<__m128i, 1>' to 'int32_t *' (aka 'int *') is not allowed
  354 |               reinterpret_cast<int32_t*>(base::span<__m128i, 1>(&index1));
      |               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The code attempts to `reinterpret_cast` a `base::span<__m128i, 1>` to `int32_t*`. This is invalid because `reinterpret_cast` is not allowed between unrelated types like a span and a raw pointer.  The spanification introduced a `base::span`, but the original `reinterpret_cast` was not updated to handle the span type, so the rewriter needs to remove the `reinterpret_cast` entirely. The problem is that `index1` was likely intended to be accessed as an array of integers.

## Solution
Remove the `reinterpret_cast` and access the underlying data of the span using `.data()` and then cast it to int32_t*.

```c++
int32_t* i1 = reinterpret_cast<int32_t*>(&index1);
```

should be changed to

```c++
int32_t* i1 = reinterpret_cast<int32_t*>(index1.data());
```

## Note
The other error was caused by the inability to create a span out of `&index1` with type `__m128i`*. Since `__m128i` itself is a 128-bit vector type, the span is being used to treat it as a contiguous array, rather than a single vector. There is no easy way to create a span to a stack allocated variable. The best solution here is to remove the span and cast and operate on the value directly.
