# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_16

## First error

../../media/muxers/mp4_movie_box_writer.cc:293:30: error: no viable conversion from 'const int *' to 'base::span<const int>'
  293 |   for (base::span<const int> it = std::begin(box_->matrix);

## Category
Rewriter doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The code attempts to initialize a `base::span` from the result of `std::begin(box_->matrix)`. `std::begin` returns a raw pointer (`const int*`), which is not directly convertible to a `base::span<const int>`. The `base::span` constructor expects either a compatible range or a raw pointer *and* a size. The call to `std::begin` only provides the raw pointer, but not the size.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to recognize `std::begin` and `std::end` and rewrite the loop to construct a span using the pointer and size. This could involve creating a temporary span variable with the correct bounds before the loop.

```c++
-  for (base::span<const int> it = std::begin(box_->matrix);
-       it != std::end(box_->matrix); ++it) {
+  auto matrix_span = base::make_span(box_->matrix);
+  for (base::span<const int> it = matrix_span;
+       it != std::end(matrix_span); ++it) {
```

## Note
The second error indicates that the loop increment `++it` is not valid for a `base::span`. The `CheckedContiguousIterator` is only incrementable using `+=`.
This error will go away if the suggestion above is implemented.
