# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1781

## First error

../../remoting/host/linux/audio_capturer_linux.cc:63:11: error: reinterpret_cast from 'std::string' (aka 'basic_string<char>') to 'const int16_t *' (aka 'const short *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The error occurs because the `reinterpret_cast` is invalid. The code attempts to cast a `std::string` (obtained via `data->as_string()`) to `const int16_t*`, which is not a valid cast.

The `IsSilence` function in `AudioSilenceDetector` was spanified, so the call site in `AudioCapturerLinux::OnDataRead` needs to pass a `base::span<const int16_t>`. However, the `data` variable is of type `std::string`, and `data->as_string()` returns a `std::string`.  The span cannot be constructed directly from a `std::string` using `reinterpret_cast` due to type incompatibility. It appears that the code generated by the spanify tool in `remoting/host/audio_silence_detector.cc` introduced the `base::span<const int16_t>` parameter. However, due to the presence of `#pragma allow_unsafe_buffers`, the rewriter did not rewrite the call site in `remoting/host/linux/audio_capturer_linux.cc`. This results in code where `reinterpret_cast` is used, which is disallowed by the style guide. The rewriter should not have modified `AudioSilenceDetector::IsSilence` in the first place since its call sites would require spanifying code with `#pragma allow_unsafe_buffers`, which is forbidden.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid spanifying functions if any of the call sites are within `#pragma allow_unsafe_buffers` regions.

## Note
There were other files modified by this patch, however this is the first error, so only it is classified.
