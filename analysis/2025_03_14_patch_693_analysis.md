# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_693

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `read` function returns a `ssize_t` which is a signed value. This value is being used as an argument to `subspan` which expects an unsigned value. The `strict_cast` is failing because it can't convert a negative value to an unsigned value.

## Solution
Cast the result of the read function to `size_t` before passing it to `subspan`.

```c++
while ((r = read(inotify_fd_, event_buf.data(),
                     (event_buf.size() *
                      sizeof(decltype(event_buf)::value_type)))) > 0) {
  base::span<char> event_ptr = event_buf;
  while (event_ptr < base::span<char>(event_buf).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(r))) {
