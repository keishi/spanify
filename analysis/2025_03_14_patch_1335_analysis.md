# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1335

## First error

../../net/test/spawned_test_server/local_test_server_posix.cc:89:54: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<uint8_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned char>') and 'ssize_t' (aka 'long'))

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The rewriter is spanifying the `ReadData` function, but failing to update its call sites correctly. The expression `buffer + bytes_read` is invalid because `buffer` is now a `base::span<uint8_t>`, and `bytes_read` is of type `ssize_t`.  The rewriter changed the function signature, but didn't updated the expression to use `.data()` on the `buffer`.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid spanifying the function because it is including system headers. Alternatively, update the call sites to use the `.data()` member on the `buffer` variable.

## Note
There are other errors in the build log.

```
../../net/test/spawned_test_server/local_test_server_posix.cc:165:21: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<uint32_t, 1>' (aka 'span<unsigned int, 1>')

      |        ^~~~~~~~
```

These errors indicate that the rewriter is failing to update the arguments being passed to the function after spanifying it. It is trying to convert `uint32_t*` to `base::span<uint32_t, 1>` which is not allowed.
