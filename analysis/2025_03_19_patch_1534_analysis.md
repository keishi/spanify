## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the `property_nodes` member in the `Schema::InternalStorage` class. The `property()` method now returns a `base::span<PropertyNode>`, and the code attempts to call `subspan()` with an `int` value (index).  The `subspan` method requires an unsigned value, leading to a type mismatch. The `strict_cast` function is used in the base::span code, but no matching version is available to cast the int to the size_t needed by subspan.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to insert a cast to `size_t` when calling `subspan()` with an `int`.

For example:

```diff
-    return schema_data_.property_nodes.subspan(index);
+    return schema_data_.property_nodes.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(index));
```

## Note
There are additional errors after the first one that are caused by using the resulting base::span object incorrectly. Namely the access to `it_->key` and iterator increment `++it_`. These are follow on errors that can be fixed after the first error has been addressed.
Also the comparator code does not correctly iterate and call the base::span's data() method. This can also be addressed after the initial strict_cast error is handled.
