# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_430

## First error

../../components/subresource_filter/core/common/test_ruleset_creator.cc:54:7: error: reinterpret_cast from 'std::string' (aka 'basic_string<char>') to 'const uint8_t *' (aka 'const unsigned char *') is not allowed
   54 |       reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(ruleset_contents);
      |       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter has spanified a variable but left a reinterpret_cast that is applied to it. In this case, `ruleset_contents` is a `std::string` which is being incorrectly cast to `const uint8_t*`. The rewriter should have updated the code to properly handle the spanified variable, likely by using `.data()` to get a pointer to the underlying data and then constructing a span from that.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be able to remove the reinterpret_cast when spanifying a variable. Or at the very least, remove the reinterpret_cast and add `.data()` after `ruleset_contents`.

## Note
The overlapping .data() and .subspan() replacements are probably a secondary error.
