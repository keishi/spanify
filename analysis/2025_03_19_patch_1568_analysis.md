# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1568

## First error

../../remoting/host/pam_authorization_factory_posix.cc:158:27: error: cannot initialize a member subobject of type 'int (*)(int, const struct pam_message **, struct pam_response **, void *)' with an lvalue of type 'int (int, base::span<const struct pam_message *>, struct pam_response **, void *)': type mismatch at 2nd parameter ('const struct pam_message **' vs 'base::span<const struct pam_message *>')

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the `PamConversation` function, but the type of the function pointer in the `pam_conv` struct was not updated. The rewriter spanified the function `PamAuthorizer::PamConversation`, but the code initializing the `pam_conv` struct in `PamAuthorizer::Authenticate` was not updated to reflect the new function signature. Specifically, the type of the `PamConversation` function pointer argument was changed from `const struct pam_message**` to `base::span<const struct pam_message*>`. The rewriter needs to update both the function declaration and the call sites when spanifying a function.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to spanify the `PamConversation` function argument type AND update the initializer list with a matching type conversion in the `PamAuthorizer::Authenticate` function. Since we don't know the size, we cannot create a span here. Thus, the rewriter should not attempt to spanify this function since it doesn't have enough info to spanify the call site.

## Note
The error message indicates a type mismatch at the 2nd parameter of the `PamConversation` function. The expected type is `const struct pam_message **`, while the actual type is `base::span<const struct pam_message *>`.
