## First error

../../net/filter/brotli_source_stream.cc:167:24: error: no viable conversion from 'size_t *' (aka 'unsigned long *') to 'base::span<size_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned long>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid creating a span from a malloc'ed pointer directly.

## Reason
The code attempts to create a `base::span<size_t>` directly from the pointer returned by `malloc`. `base::span` requires a contiguous range, but `malloc` only provides a pointer to a memory block, not a container with size information. The rewriter needs to construct a `base::span` from a container that manages the memory and provides size information, or use a different approach altogether.

## Solution
1. Change the code to allocate a `std::vector<size_t>` instead of using malloc.
2. Construct the span from the std::vector.
3. Replace `array.empty()` with `array.size() == 0`

```c++
-    base::span<size_t> array =
+    std::vector<size_t> array =
         reinterpret_cast<size_t*>(malloc(size + sizeof(size_t)));
-    if (array.empty()) {
+    if (array.size() == 0) {
       return nullptr;
     }
```

## Note
Alternatively, the rewriter could have recognized that malloc was being used, and then allocated a `struct` that stored both size and pointer to a raw `size_t[]`. Then the base::span can be generated using that `struct` as the contiguous range. This alternative is difficult to implement so it was avoided.
