## First error

../../base/synchronization/waitable_event_posix.cc:348:57: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('element_type *' (aka 'std::pair<base::WaitableEvent *, unsigned long> *') and 'base::span<std::pair<WaitableEvent *, size_t>>' (aka 'span<pair<base::WaitableEvent *, unsigned long>>'))

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The variable `waitables` is converted to `base::span`. The line in question is attempting to compare a pointer obtained from a subspan (`waitables.subspan(count - 1).data()`) with the original `waitables` variable itself. In the original code, the loop iterates backward through an array using pointer arithmetic. After the conversion to `base::span`, the type of `waitables.subspan(count - 1).data()` becomes `element_type*` (aka `std::pair<WaitableEvent *, unsigned long>*`). The comparison `w >= waitables` is no longer valid because `waitables` is now a `base::span` object, not a pointer.

## Solution
The rewriter should replace the comparison with a comparison based on iterators or indices within the span. Instead of comparing the pointer `w` with the span `waitables`, it should compare the current element being pointed to by `w` with the base of span.

```c++
// Original code
for (auto* w = waitables.subspan(count - 1).data(); w >= waitables; --w) {
    ...
}

// Modified Code
for (size_t i = count - 1; i < count; --i) {
    auto& w = waitables[i];
    ...
}
```

## Note
The error message highlights a type mismatch, indicating that the comparison operators are not correctly overloaded or defined between a raw pointer and the `base::span` type. The candidate functions listed in the error log are not viable because they expect either two spans or two objects of the same type.
