# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_909

## First error

../../media/muxers/mp4_muxer_box_writer_unittest.cc:1064:43: error: no viable conversion from 'const unsigned int *' to 'base::span<const unsigned int>'

## Category
Rewriter doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The code attempts to assign the result of `std::begin(kSampleDurations)` to a `base::span<const unsigned int>` variable. The `std::begin` function returns a raw pointer (`const unsigned int *`), and there is no implicit conversion from a raw pointer to `base::span` without providing the size information. The rewriter should use the appropriate `base::span` constructor or helper function (`make_span`) to create the `base::span` from the raw pointer.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate code that uses `base::make_span` to explicitly construct a `base::span` object from the iterator pair provided by `std::begin` and `std::end`. For example, replace
```c++
base::span<const unsigned int> iter = std::begin(kSampleDurations);
```
with
```c++
base::span<const unsigned int> iter = base::make_span(std::begin(kSampleDurations), std::end(kSampleDurations));
```

## Note
The error message indicates that none of the `base::span` constructors are viable for the given argument. The other error is caused by trying to increment the span object using `++iter`, which isn't supported and must be rewritten as `++iter`.
