## First error

../../testing/libfuzzer/proto/skia_image_filter_proto_converter.cc:1146:21: error: no viable conversion from 'float *' to 'base::span<float>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The rewriter is trying to assign a raw pointer to a `base::span<float>`. In this case, `kColorTableBuffer` is a raw buffer. The rewriter should generate code to create a `span` from the buffer.

## Solution
Instead of trying to assign to a span, construct the span directly. The span can be constructed given a pointer and size.

```c++
- float* dst = reinterpret_cast<float*>(kColorTableBuffer);
+ base::span<float> dst(reinterpret_cast<float*>(kColorTableBuffer), kColorTableBufferSize);
```

You would also need to calculate the size kColorTableBufferSize.

## Note
The loop is incrementing dst which span does not support. The loop should instead use an array index.
Also, the third error is happening because the rewriter converted kColorTableBuffer to span, but returned the `.data()` from it. It should be directly returning kColorTableBuffer instead.
