# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_914

## First error
../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `index` variable in `Schema::InternalStorage::properties` is an `int`, but `base::span::subspan()` requires an unsigned integer.  The rewriter failed to insert the proper cast to `size_t` or `unsigned`. The `strict_cast` in `base::numerics::safe_conversions.h` doesn't allow implicit conversion between signed and unsigned integers.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to insert a cast to `static_cast<size_t>(index)` when calling `subspan`.

## Note
The rewriter is using pointer arithmetic instead of span's `operator[]`.
