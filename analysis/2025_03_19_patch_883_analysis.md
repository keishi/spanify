## First error

../../chrome/browser/safe_browsing/extension_telemetry/extension_telemetry_persister.cc:104:68: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union

      |                                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The code attempts to use `.subspan()` on the return value of `kPersistedFileNamePrefix.data()`, which returns a span. `AppendASCII` expects a `char*` but receives a `span`. However the return value was not properly handled and `.data()` was not appended to the result to get a `char*`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to add `.data()` to a return value that has been spanified. Change the code to:

```c++
dir_path_.AppendASCII((kPersistedFileNamePrefix.data().subspan(base::NumberToString(read_index_ + 1))).data())
```
