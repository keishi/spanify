## First error

../../ui/gfx/skbitmap_operations_unittest.cc:76:27: error: no viable conversion from 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<SkPMColor>' (aka 'span<unsigned int>')
   76 |     base::span<SkPMColor> pixels = bitmap.getAddr32(0, y);
      |                           ^        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The code is trying to assign the raw pointer returned by the third-party function `bitmap.getAddr32()` directly to a `base::span`. The rewriter doesn't generate the necessary code to create a span from the raw pointer. SkBitmap::getAddr32() is a third party function, so it cannot be rewritten. Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function, but the size is hard to identify.

## Solution
The rewriter should generate a span from the return value, and add `static_cast` to tell what it refers to, i.e., `base::span(bitmap.getAddr32(0, y), bitmap.width())`.

## Note
The error arises because the implicit conversion from a raw pointer to a `base::span` is not available.
