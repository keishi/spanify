## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/tests/gl_copy_texture_CHROMIUM_unittest.cc:334:20: error: incompatible operand types ('uint8_t[4]' (aka 'unsigned char[4]') and 'std::array<uint8_t, 4>' (aka 'array<unsigned char, 4>'))
  334 |               (alt ? alt_expected_color : expected_color)[j];

## Category
Rewriter needs to handle the ternary operator with the array.

## Reason
The code uses the ternary operator `?:` to select between a C-style array (`uint8_t[4]`) and a `std::array<uint8_t, 4>`. The ternary operator requires both operands to be of the same type, or implicitly convertible to the same type. Since `uint8_t[4]` and `std::array<uint8_t, 4>` are not implicitly convertible to each other, the compiler throws an error.

The rewriter replaced this line
```c++
GLTestHelper::CheckPixels(0, 0, 1, 1, 0, (alt ? alt_expected_color : expected_color), nullptr);
```
with
```c++
GLTestHelper::CheckPixels(0, 0, 1, 1, 0, (alt ? alt_expected_color : expected_color), {});
```

The `expected_color` is `std::array<uint8_t, 4>` and the `alt_expected_color` is `uint8_t[4]`.

## Solution
The rewriter should ensure that both sides of the ternary operator are of the same type. This can be achieved by converting the raw array to `std::array` before the ternary operator. The rewriter can create a temporary std::array.

```c++
std::array<uint8_t, 4> temp_expected_color = alt_expected_color;
GLTestHelper::CheckPixels(0, 0, 1, 1, 0, (alt ? temp_expected_color : expected_color), {});
```

## Note
The remaining errors in the log appear to be follow-on errors caused by the first error.
