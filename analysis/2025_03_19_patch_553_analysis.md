## First error

../../components/webcrypto/fuzzer_support.cc:114:9: error: cannot increment value of type 'base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>')

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The original code was incrementing a `uint8_t*`. After the rewriter made this variable `base::span<const uint8_t>`, the code is now attempting to increment the span itself, which is invalid. It is trying to modify a `base::span<const uint8_t>`. The original code was doing pointer arithmetic so `.subspan()` rewrite should happen.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize that `data++` should become `data = data.subspan(1)`.

+    data = data.subspan(1);
 
     if (byte == 0x00 || byte == 0xFF)
       continue;
```

## Note
The rewriter also failed to add .data() when calling webcrypto::ImportKey() which is third party code.
```
webcrypto::ImportKey(
-      blink::kWebCryptoKeyFormatRaw, base::span(data, size),
+      blink::kWebCryptoKeyFormatRaw, base::span(data.data(), size),
```
The error message is also misleading. It refers to the "value of type" when it should say the variable itself is not incrementable.
