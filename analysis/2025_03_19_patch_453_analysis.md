## First error

../../net/cookies/cookie_monster_unittest.cc:1507:56: error: no viable conversion from 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') to 'const std::string' (aka 'const basic_string<char>')
 1507 |   EXPECT_TRUE(SetCookie(cm.get(), http_www_foo_.url(), kValidCookieLine));
      |                                                        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The diff shows that `kValidCookieLine` was changed from `char[]` to `std::string_view`. The `SetCookie` function in `cookie_store_unittest.h` expects a `const std::string&`. When `kValidCookieLine` was a `char[]`, it could implicitly convert to `std::string`. However, `std::string_view` does not implicitly convert to `std::string`, thus causing a compile error. However the rewriter should not have modified kValidCookieLine.

## Solution
Remove the `.data()` calls added to `kValidCookieLine`

## Note
Several errors indicate a mismatch between `std::string_view` and `std::string` where the argument is `kValidCookieLine`. This suggests a broader issue with how `kValidCookieLine` is being used throughout the code. The rewriter seems to have incorrectly tried to account for this broader issue.
