# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_491

## First error

../../services/device/serial/bluetooth_serial_port_impl_unittest.cc:228:27: error: no matching function for call to 'byte_span_from_cstring'

## Category
Rewriter encountered a case where it failed to add .data() when converting a C-style array to std::array in a third_party function call.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `kBuffer` from a C-style array `char[]` to a `std::array<char, 5>`. However, `base::byte_span_from_cstring` expects a C-style array as input, not a `std::array`. It should have added `.data()` to `kBuffer` to pass a C-style array to `base::byte_span_from_cstring`.

## Solution
When converting a C-style array to std::array, the rewriter should add `.data()` when that variable is passed to a function call that expects a C-style array. The rewriter should be modified to recognize when a `std::array` is being passed to a function that expects a C-style array and automatically add `.data()` to the variable. In this case, the rewriter should have generated `base::byte_span_from_cstring(kBuffer.data())` instead of `base::byte_span_from_cstring(kBuffer)`.

## Note
Additional errors occurred due to missing `.data()` when passing kBuffer to `std::char_traits<char>::length` in other locations. The rewriter should be updated to handle all cases correctly. A third error also ocurred due to `net::StringIOBuffer` not having a constructor that takes `std::array<char, 5>`. This is a secondary effect from the same root cause.
