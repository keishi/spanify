# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_15_patch_1948

## First error

../../media/gpu/vaapi/test/vp8_decoder.cc:149:17: error: static assertion failed due to requirement 'std::extent<std::array<signed char, 4>, 0>() == std::extent<unsigned char[4], 0>()': loop filter level arrays mismatch

## Category
Rewriter needs to preserve the signedness of the underlying type when using std::array.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `int8_t lf_update_value[kMaxMBSegments];` to `std::array<int8_t, kMaxMBSegments> lf_update_value;`. However, the code is comparing it to `unsigned char[4]` and expecting them to have the same signedness.

## Solution
The rewriter should check the signedness of the underlying C-style array and preserve the same signedness when generating the `std::array`.

## Note
The error occurs in `../../media/gpu/vaapi/test/vp8_decoder.cc` so it is not a direct compilation error from the change to `media/parsers/vp8_parser.h`.
The type of `pic_param.loop_filter_level` is `unsigned char[4]` which is causing this static assert to fail.
