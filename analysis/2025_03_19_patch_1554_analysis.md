## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code is calling `subspan()` with an argument that is not explicitly cast to `size_t`. This leads to a type mismatch during the call to `strict_cast` within `base::span::subspan()`, because it cannot convert `int` to `size_t`.

## Solution
The rewriter should add an explicit cast to `size_t` for the argument to `subspan()`.

For example, the following code:

```c++
base::span<const GLuint>(fb_ids).subspan(1).data()
```

Should be rewritten to:

```c++
base::span<const GLuint>(fb_ids).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(1)).data()
