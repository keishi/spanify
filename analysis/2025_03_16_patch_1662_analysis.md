## First error

../../remoting/host/linux/remoting_user_session.cc:259:23: error: no viable conversion from 'char **' to 'base::span<char *>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to handle return value of pam_getenvlist() as `char **` and convert it to `base::span<char*>`.

## Reason
The function `pam_getenvlist` returns a `char **`, which the rewriter attempts to convert to `base::span<char*>`. The error indicates there's no viable constructor for `base::span` that directly accepts a `char **`. The rewriter does not properly generate a temporary array to copy the `char**` elements to make the span. Also, when iterating through a `base::span` of pointers, to check against a nullptr, you must index the span variable, not compare the span to the nullptr.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate code that iterates over the `char **` and copies each `char *` into a `std::vector<char*>`. Then, it can create a `base::span` from that vector.
Also change the `variable[0] != nullptr` loop condition to a loop of the form `i < variable.size()` to prevent errors.
Also, free each string using `std::free(variable[i])` and free the `data()` after the loop using `std::free(environment.data());`

## Note
The code has a secondary error where the span increment is attempting `++variable` rather than incrementing the index.
