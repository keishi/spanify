# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1741

## First error

../../mojo/core/data_pipe_unittest.cc:1598:24: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'MojoHandle *' (aka 'unsigned long *') to 'base::span<MojoHandle, 1>' (aka 'span<unsigned long, 1>')

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The code attempts to construct a `base::span<MojoHandle, 1>` from the address of a `MojoHandle` variable (`&producer_`). The `ReadEmptyMessageWithHandles` function now expects a `base::span<MojoHandle>`, but the call sites were not correctly updated to pass a span object. The compiler cannot implicitly convert a raw pointer (`MojoHandle*`) to a span, resulting in the "no matching conversion" error. The rewriter failed to recognize a size info unavailable rhs value.

## Solution
The rewriter must be able to identify these call sites and wrap the raw pointer with `base::span<MojoHandle, 1>(&variable)` expression where `variable` is the raw pointer and the function's parameter type is `base::span<MojoHandle>`.

## Note
The same error occurs in multiple test cases. This indicates a systematic issue in how the rewriter handles spanified functions with raw pointer arguments in test code.
