# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1664

## First error

../../components/password_manager/core/browser/ui/passwords_grouper.cc:61:54: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
  61 |   std::string query = kFallbackIconQueryParams.data().subspan(

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
`kFallbackIconQueryParams` was converted to `std::array`, but its usage with `.data()` caused an error. The rewriter converted this to  `kFallbackIconQueryParams.data().subspan(...)`. This is incorrect because `kFallbackIconQueryParams.data()` returns a `char*`, which doesn't have the `.subspan()` method. The rewriter should have removed `.data()` when spanifying the return value.

## Solution
The rewriter should not add `.data()` to the spanified return value in this context, or should rewrite this code.

## Note
No other errors found.
