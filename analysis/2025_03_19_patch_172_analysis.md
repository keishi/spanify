# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_172

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webaudio/cpu/x86/oscillator_kernel_sse2.cc:153:9: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'const __m128i *' to 'base::span<const __m128i, 1>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
Rewriter has spanified a variable but left a reinterpret_cast that is applied to it. Rewriter needs to be able to remove it.

## Solution
The rewriter should remove the `reinterpret_cast` since span does not need it.

## Note
There's also a second error about reinterpret_cast from `base::span` to `const uint32_t*`.
