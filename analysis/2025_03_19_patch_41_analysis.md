## First error

../../ui/gfx/color_space.cc:310:32: error: member reference base type 'const float[7]' is not a structure or union
  310 |     if (memcmp(transfer_params_.data(), other.transfer_params_.data(),
      |                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The rewriter incorrectly added `.data()` to `transfer_params_` and `other.transfer_params_`.  These members were not converted to `std::array` or `base::span`, so the `.data()` call is invalid.

## Solution
The rewriter logic must be updated to ensure that `.data()` is only added to variables that are actually rewritten to `std::array` or `base::span`.

## Note
The rewriter also attempted to create a `base::span` from `transfer_params_`, but this is not possible because the variable is an array, not a pointer. The rewriter should not attempt to create a `base::span` from an array if it is not necessary.
