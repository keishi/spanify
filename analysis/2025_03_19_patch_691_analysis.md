# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_691

## First error

../../components/headless/screen_info/headless_screen_info.cc:104:45: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The rewriter attempts to add both `.data()` and `.subspan()` to the `kInvalidScreenIsInternal` member, but generates invalid C++ syntax.  The rewriter incorrectly assumed that the object was spanified before adding `.data()`, resulting in the `.subspan()` call being applied to the raw character pointer obtained from `.data()`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to ensure that `.subspan()` is correctly applied to the `std::array` object and not the raw `char *` pointer. The rewriter added ".data()" to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

Remove the `.data()` that was added by the rewriter.

## Note
The fix should be to either call `subspan` on the std::array before the `.data()` conversion, or drop `.subspan()` since it isn't supported by the code. The latter is the safer approach since this sounds like it would be an invalid replacement regardless of this crash.
