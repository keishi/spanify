# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1579

## First error

../../components/omnibox/browser/history_url_provider_unittest.cc:1246:10: error: suggest braces around initialization of subobject [-Werror,-Wmissing-braces]

## Category
Rewriter needs to use double braces for initialization of nested structs/arrays when converting to `std::array`.

## Reason
The rewriter converted a C-style array to `std::array`. However, the original code used a single set of braces for initializing a nested structure. The compiler is now suggesting to add braces around the initialization of the subobject. The rewriter should use double braces to fix this initialization.

## Solution
The rewriter should change the initialization to use double braces for each nested structure when converting the C-style array to `std::array`.

Example:
```diff
-    ExpectedMatch matches[kProviderMaxMatches];
+    std::array<ExpectedMatch, kProviderMaxMatches> matches;
   } test_cases[] = {
       // Max score 2000 -> no demotion.
-      {"7.com/1",
+      {{"7.com/1",
```

## Note
The error also includes 'excess elements in struct initializer', which also indicates the need for double braces. Also, there was a failure to compile due to the wrong usage of std::size with the array. However, the original patch didn't cause this. This was an unrelated problem in the code.
