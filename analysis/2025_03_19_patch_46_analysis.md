# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_46

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/audio/cpu/x86/delay_sse2.cc:119:9: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'const __m128i *' to 'base::span<const __m128i, 1>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter introduced a `reinterpret_cast` from a pointer type to a `base::span` type. This cast is unnecessary and causes a compilation error. The rewriter should use a direct initialization of the span.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid adding the `reinterpret_cast`. It can directly construct the `base::span` from the address of `v_read_index2`.

## Note
The second error is also a result of the `reinterpret_cast`.
