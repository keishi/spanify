# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_161

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The rewriter introduced a call to `std::distance` which returns a signed integer. The return value of `std::distance` is then used as argument to the `subspan` method, which expects an unsigned integer as argument. This causes a compilation error, since there is no implicit conversion.

## Solution
Cast the result of `std::distance` to `size_t` before passing it to the `subspan` method. This will ensure that the argument is an unsigned integer.

```c++
base::span<const OffsetMappingUnit> unit =
      base::span<const blink::OffsetMappingUnit>(range).subspan(
          static_cast<size_t>(std::distance(range.begin(), i) - 1));
```

## Note
There are other errors in the build log that are caused by using the `base::span` variable as if it was a pointer. These errors will need to be addressed after this first error is fixed.
