# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_16_patch_1889

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/graphics/logging_canvas.cc:215:45: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('std::array<SkPoint, 4>' and 'unsigned int')
  215 |                          UNSAFE_TODO(points + verb_params.point_offset));
      |                                      ~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to adjust for function calls that take `.data()` in spanified code.

## Reason
The code uses `iter.next(points.data())` which is a third party function that takes a `SkPoint*`. The spanified code in LoggingCanvas::LogPathItem() was attempting to do pointer arithmetic on the `points` variable. This pattern is invalid when points is a `std::array`.
```c++
 SkPath::RawIter iter(path);
  std::array<SkPoint, 4> points;
  auto path_points_array = std::make_unique<JSONArray>();
  for (SkPath::Verb verb = iter.next(points.data()); verb != SkPath::kDone_Verb;
       verb = iter.next(points.data())) {
    VerbParams verb_params = SegmentParams(verb);
    auto path_point_item = std::make_unique<JSONObject>();
    path_point_item->SetString("verb", verb_params.name);
    UNSAFE_TODO(points + verb_params.point_offset);
```
The error occurs because the code attempts to add `verb_params.point_offset` to `points`, which is now a `std::array`.  You cannot directly add an integer to a `std::array`.

## Solution
The spanified code can no longer add the verb_params.point_offset as an offset from the points array. Delete the last line as it is not valid.
```c++
 path_point_item->SetString("verb", verb_params.name);
    UNSAFE_TODO(points + verb_params.point_offset);
```

## Note
It is likely this code should be logging the data in the points array, however without more context it is impossible to infer what the correct action should be. Since the logging will not affect performance, it has been marked to be deleted.
