# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1068

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:813:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The code attempts to iterate over `kShortcutSameAsDSPKeywordTestProviders` using a `base::span` iterator. However, `std::begin` returns a raw pointer (`policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *`), and there is no implicit conversion from a raw pointer to a `base::span`. This is likely a bug in the rewriter because it spanified a call site, but failed to properly convert arguments to span, likely because size information is not available.

## Solution
The rewriter should be updated to correctly handle raw pointers when used as arguments to spanified functions, specifically when iterating over C-style arrays. The rewriter should create a span from the beginning and the end of the C-style array.

```c++
-  for (base::span<policy::TestProvider> it =
+  for (base::span<policy::TestProvider> it(kShortcutSameAsDSPKeywordTestProviders, std::size(kShortcutSameAsDSPKeywordTestProviders));

```

## Note
The second error message indicates that the `++it` operation on the `base::span<policy::TestProvider>` is also not working, likely because the iterator is not correctly constructed. Both of the errors are caused by an issue when creating `base::span` from raw pointer.
