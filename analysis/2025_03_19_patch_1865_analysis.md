# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1865

## First error

../../ui/base/resource/resource_bundle.cc:130:42: error: reinterpret_cast from 'std::string_view' (aka 'basic_string_view<char>') to 'const uint8_t *' (aka 'const unsigned char *') is not allowed
  130 |   base::span<const uint8_t> data_bytes = reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(data);
      |                                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The code attempts to `reinterpret_cast` a `std::string_view` to a `const uint8_t*` and then create a span from it. However, reinterpret_cast is not allowed by the style guide when the result of `reinterpret_cast` is assigned to a spanified variable. The rewriter should recognize this pattern and rewrite the code to avoid the `reinterpret_cast`.

## Solution
The rewriter should be able to recognize the reinterp_cast followed by span conversion and rewrite. The code could be rewritten by first creating the span and then calling `.data()`:

```c++
//Original
base::span<const uint8_t> data_bytes = reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(data);

//Rewritten
base::span<const char> char_span = base::make_span(data);
base::span<const uint8_t> data_bytes = base::make_span(reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(char_span.data()), char_span.size());
```

This conversion is still technically unsafe, however it is allowed because it isn't directly casting to the raw_ptr, and can also be validated with a test.

## Note
The second error `../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'` happens because subspan(1) returns a span, not a `uint8_t`. The code needs to index into the `span` to get the `uint8_t`. To solve this error, consider writing `(data_bytes.subspan(1).data())[0]` instead of `(data_bytes.subspan(1)[0])`. However, this code may not be reached if the first error can be fixed.
