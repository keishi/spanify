# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_669

## First error

../../ui/events/ozone/evdev/event_converter_evdev_impl.cc:116:22: error: member reference base type 'input_event[4]' is not a structure or union
  116 |       read(fd, inputs.data(),
      |                ~~~~~~^~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to recognize arrayified variable and use .data() on that to pass to function call.

## Reason
The `inputs` variable is an array, but rewriter did not recognize that and attempted to call `.data()` on it like it is a span or a vector.
Passing `inputs` to `base::span` works implicitly because `inputs` can decay to a pointer. Passing `inputs` to `read` is similar because `read` takes a pointer as an argument. However the rewriter is inserting `.data()` to explicitly convert to a pointer, which fails since inputs is a C-style array.

## Solution
The rewriter should not insert `.data()` when the target variable is a C-style array that decays to a pointer.

## Note
The rewriter incorrectly tried to use `.size()` on the array and also `decltype(inputs)::value_type`. Both of these are invalid on an array.
