# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_900

## First error
../../media/mojo/mojom/audio_decoder_config_mojom_traits_unittest.cc:103:29: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') to 'base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to create a `base::span<const uint8_t>` from a `const std::string_view`. However, `std::string_view`'s `data()` method returns a `const char*`, and there's no implicit conversion from `const char*` to `const uint8_t*`, hence the "no matching conversion" error. The rewriter spanified a function that now requires types that the rewriter cannot correctly generate at the call site. The rewriter should avoid spanifying functions that require rewriting excluded code. This is because the std::string_view type is excluded and the rewriter is not supposed to change functions in ways that break compatibility with excluded types.

## Solution
Revert the change in media/mojo/mojom/audio_decoder_config_mojom_traits_unittest.cc and avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Note
The issue is that the rewriter should not have spanified the function if it depended on rewriting excluded types.
