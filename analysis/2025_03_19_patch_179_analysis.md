# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_179

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webaudio/cpu/x86/oscillator_kernel_sse2.cc:261:41: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from '__m128i *' to 'base::span<__m128i, 1>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
Rewriter spanified `v_read0` but didn't remove a `reinterpret_cast` being used on it.

## Solution
Remove the `reinterpret_cast`. The rewriter also needs a mechanism to automatically remove such casts.

## Note
Also a reinterpret cast is not allowed from 'base::span<__m128i, 1>' to 'const unsigned int *' in the code.
