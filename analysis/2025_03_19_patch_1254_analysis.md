# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1254

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `strict_cast` in `safe_conversions.h` doesn't have an overload that supports casting from `int` to `unsigned long`. The `subspan()` method takes a `size_t` which is an unsigned type. The value `0` passed into it is of type `int`, which is causing the compiler error.

## Solution
The rewriter should cast the argument to `subspan()` to `static_cast<size_t>()`. This will ensure that the correct type is used for the argument.

For example, the code should be changed from:

```c++
set_u64le(base::span<uint8_t>(data).subspan(0), d);
```

to:

```c++
set_u64le(base::span<uint8_t>(data).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(0)), d);
```

## Note
There were no secondary errors in this build failure log.
