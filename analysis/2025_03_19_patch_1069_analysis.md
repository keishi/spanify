# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1069

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:905:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'

## Category
Rewriter doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The original code was using iterators returned by `std::begin` and `std::end` to iterate through an array. However, the rewriter replaced the iterator with a `base::span` which cannot be directly assigned from the iterator. The rewriter needs to be able to handle this conversion or avoid spanifying this. The error indicates there is no viable conversion from `policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *` to `base::span<policy::TestProvider>`. This assignment happened when initializing the loop variable.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to recognize this pattern and correctly rewrite the loop. One solution is to avoid spanifying the loop initialization and leave it with iterators. Alternatively the loop should be rewritten to iterate using indices so it will use `.size()` to determine when to stop.

## Note
The build log includes the error message:
```
../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:905:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'
  905 |   for (base::span<policy::TestProvider> it =
      |                                         ^
  906 |            std::begin(kTestProvidersWithFeaturedEntries);
      |            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```
This error shows that the rewriter failed to convert the iterator returned by `std::begin` into a `base::span`.
