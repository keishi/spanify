# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_13_patch_1585

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/core/css/properties/css_bitset_test.cc:55:45: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<const size_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned long>') and 'const size_t *' (aka 'const unsigned long *'))
   55 |   for (base::span<const size_t>b = begin; b != end; b++) {
      |                                           ~ ^  ~~~

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `AssertBitset` was spanified, but the loop condition `b != end` is now comparing a `base::span<const size_t>` with a `const size_t*`, which is invalid. The compiler cannot find a matching `operator!=` for these two types.

## Solution
The loop condition needs to operate on the `span` and not the raw pointer. We can achieve this by using iterators:

```c++
for (auto it = begin.begin(); it != end; ++it) {
```

The patch could not be auto-applied with the available tool because it also has multiple instances where there are no matching conversion for function-style cast from 'size_t *' to 'base::span<size_t, 1>'. This should be split into a different patch.

## Note
The log also shows lots of "no matching conversion for functional-style cast" errors and also missing functions calls which also need to be addressed in different patches. The error is related to explicitly constructing span from an address `&i`. This can be fixed by changing the constructor to something the compiler can properly convert to like:
```c++
base::span<size_t, 1> s(&i,1);
AssertBitset<129>(s, &i + 1);
