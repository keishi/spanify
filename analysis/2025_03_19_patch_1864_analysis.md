# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1864

## First error

../../ui/linux/linux_ui.cc:100:52: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('value_type *' (aka 'char *') and 'base::span<char>')
  100 |     snprintf(dst.data(), &cmd_line.args.back() + 1 - dst, "%s", arg.c_str());

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified `dst`, but failed to properly rewrite the pointer arithmetic expression `&cmd_line.args.back() + 1 - dst` to use `.data()` on the spanified variable. `dst` is a `base::span<char>` object.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to add `.data()` to access the underlying raw pointer when performing pointer arithmetic with a spanified variable. The expression should be changed to: `&cmd_line.args.back() + 1 - dst.data()`.

## Note
There are no extra errors in the build log.
