# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1422

## First error

../../chrome/browser/devtools/device/usb/android_usb_browsertest.cc:254:11: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>') to 'const uint32_t *' (aka 'const unsigned int *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter introduced a `reinterpret_cast` on a variable that it had converted to `base::span`. `reinterpret_cast` from a span to a pointer of a different type is not allowed. It looks like the underlying problem is that the code assumed a `buffer` containing raw data could be reinterpreted as a `uint32_t` array, however the span version disallows this operation. The rewriter should not have spanified the variable if doing so required a reinterpret_cast to a uint32_t.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to avoid spanifying `buffer` in this case, as it cannot properly support the `reinterpret_cast` to `const uint32_t*`. The rewriter needs to detect this pattern and skip spanifying `buffer` if it is used in a `reinterpret_cast` expression.

## Note
The error message indicates a type conversion issue: the rewriter is attempting to convert a `base::span<const uint8_t>` to a `const uint32_t*` using `reinterpret_cast`, which is disallowed.
