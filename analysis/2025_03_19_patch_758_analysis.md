## First error

../../components/pwg_encoder/pwg_encoder.cc:229:9: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>') to 'const uint32_t *' (aka 'const unsigned int *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the `current_row` variable but left a `reinterpret_cast` that is applied to it. The rewriter should be able to remove it. This is an unsafe cast, as it's casting a span of `uint8_t` to a pointer of `uint32_t`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be able to detect the existing `reinterpret_cast` and transform the code to use `data()` before applying the cast. So the code would look like this:
```c++
reinterpret_cast<const uint32_t*>(current_row.data());
```
This may also require modifying the `EncodeRow` function to take `base::span<const uint32_t>`.

## Note
There are additional errors that are related to the first one.
