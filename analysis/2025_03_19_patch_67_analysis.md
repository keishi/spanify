# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_67

## First error

../../services/tracing/public/cpp/perfetto/trace_packet_tokenizer.cc:43:21: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>') and 'const uint8_t *' (aka 'const unsigned char *'))

## Category
Rewriter needs to handle comparison between span and raw pointer.

## Reason
The comparison between `packet_ptr` and `data_end` is failing because `packet_ptr` is now a `base::span<const uint8_t>`, while `data_end` is a `const uint8_t*`. The rewriter did not rewrite the comparison to account for the spanified variable. The rewriter needs to recognize that these two types are being compared, and rewrite the comparison to work with spans (e.g. by converting the span to a pointer using `.data()`).

## Solution
The rewriter should rewrite the comparison to use `.data()` on the span to extract the pointer for comparison. For example, the original code `packet_ptr < data_end` should become `packet_ptr.data() < data_end`.

## Note
The same error occurs again in line 79. It seems that there are several places where `span` is being compared with raw pointers.
The third error is in line 95, but this is a different kind of error.
