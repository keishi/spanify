# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1819

## First error

../../net/base/address_tracker_linux.cc:50:48: error: cannot cast from type 'base::span<const struct ifinfomsg>' to pointer type 'char *'

## Category
Rewriter failed to correctly convert a pointer to a span.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `SafelyCastNetlinkMsgData` to return a `base::span`, however this function was used in a macro that expects a pointer. The rewriter needs to handle this cast correctly.

## Solution
The rewriter should check for these cases and add `.data()` when a span is being passed to a macro that expects a pointer.

## Note
The conversion of `SafelyCastNetlinkMsgData` to return a `base::span` also caused issues because struct members are accessed using `.` rather than `->`.
