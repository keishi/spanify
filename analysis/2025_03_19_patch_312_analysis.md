# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_312

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/scheduler/main_thread/main_thread_metrics_helper.cc:64:12: error: no viable conversion from 'const char[51]' to 'blink::CustomCountHistogram'

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The rewriter is trying to convert an array of `CustomCountHistogram` to `std::array`, but the `CustomCountHistogram` does not have a default constructor and it only has an explicit constructor, so the aggregate initialization fails.

The code was originally using `CustomCountHistogram queueing_delay_histograms_[static_cast<size_t>(TaskPriority::kPriorityCount)];`
and the size is defined via `QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_INIT`, so it was likely using some initialization values as the array is created.

But the `CustomCountHistogram` only has an explicit constructor: `explicit CustomCountHistogram(base::HistogramBase*)` and there is no conversion from `const char[51]` or `int` to it.

## Solution
Instead of trying to rewrite the array, the rewriter should create a loop and call the constructor to build an equivalent array.

## Note
The error occurs at this line:
```c++
std::array<CustomCountHistogram,
             static_cast<size_t>(TaskPriority::kPriorityCount)>
      queueing_delay_histograms_;
```

The constructor of `CustomCountHistogram` is explicit, so implicit conversions to it are not allowed, but the array is being initialized with a list of character arrays and integers.
```c++
   64 |           {QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_INIT("Control")},
