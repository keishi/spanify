# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_696

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The rewriter failed to generate an explicit cast to `size_t` (or `unsigned long` which is the underlying type of `size_t`) when calling `subspan()`. This is needed because `rows * row_bytes` is of type `int`, and `subspan` expects an argument of type `size_t`. The error message indicates that `strict_cast<unsigned long>(value)` failed because the constraints were not satisfied.

## Solution
The rewriter should generate an explicit cast to `size_t` (or `unsigned long`):
```c++
dst_plane=dst_plane.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(rows * row_bytes));
```

## Note
There is a secondary error:
```
../../media/gpu/test/raw_video.cc:271:54: error: extraneous ')' before ';'
  271 |         dst_plane=dst_plane.subspan(rows * row_bytes));
      |                                                      ^
```
This is likely due to the rewriter failing to remove the existing semicolon after adding `dst_plane.data()`. This can be solved with `SourceEdit::createRemoval`.
```c++
print("Overlapping replacements between AppendDataCall and RewriteArraySizeof.")
