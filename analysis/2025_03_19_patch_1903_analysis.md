## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code is calling `memcpy` with `data.size()`, which is an `int`.  `memcpy` expects a `size_t` for its size argument.  The code was also calling `Front().subspan(used_)`, where `used_` is an `int`. `StrictNumeric` does not allow implicit conversion from `int` to `size_t` without a `strict_cast`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate a `strict_cast<size_t>` when converting `int` to `size_t` when calling `base::span::subspan()`.

## Note
There is also an error about returning a `pointer` instead of a `base::span<uint8_t>`, and about assigning a `base::span<uint8_t>` to a `const uint8_t*`. The first error is the main one to fix, and likely the rewriter made a mistake.
