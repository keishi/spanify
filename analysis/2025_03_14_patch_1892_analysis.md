# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1892

## First error

../../components/reporting/storage/storage_unittest.cc:993:31: error: expected expression
  993 |                .subspan(sizeof)
      |                               ^

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to rewrite code that uses both .data() and .subspan(). The replacements for these two methods are conflicting and placed in the wrong place, leading to a syntax error. In this case, it looks like the rewriter has placed the `.data()` call inside the arguments of the `subspan` call.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to correctly handle cases where both `.data()` and `.subspan()` are used on the same variable. The logic for adding these methods needs to be adjusted to avoid conflicting replacements and ensure the correct syntax.

## Note
The second error confirms that the misplaced .data() call is the problem.
