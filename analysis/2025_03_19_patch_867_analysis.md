## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter added `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_autogen.h`. But this header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside the `gpu::gles2::GLES2Interface` class declaration.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid including `base/containers/span.h` in header files that are inside a class definition. This can be done by checking if the current file is inside a class definition before adding the include.

## Note
The error messages indicate multiple issues, including redefinition of `size_t` and missing members in the `std` namespace. These are all likely caused by the incorrect inclusion of system headers within the class definition.
