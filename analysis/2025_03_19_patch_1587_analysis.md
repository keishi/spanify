## First error

../../components/reporting/util/file_unittest.cc:204:29: error: no matching function for call to 'MaybeWriteFile'
204 |   const auto write_status = MaybeWriteFile(file_path, kMultiLineData);

## Category
Rewriter needs to add .data() to arrayified `char[]` variable used with std::string.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `kMultiLineData` from `char[]` to `std::array<char, 13>`. The `MaybeWriteFile` function expects a `std::string_view` as the second argument. When `kMultiLineData` was a `char[]`, it could implicitly convert to a `std::string_view`. After the conversion to `std::array`, this implicit conversion no longer works and requires a `.data()` call to get a `char*` which can implicitly convert to `std::string_view`.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize that the arrayified `char[]` variable is being used in a context where a `std::string_view` is expected, and add a `.data()` call.

## Note
The code change in `FileTest::RemoveAndTruncateLine` test also needs `.data()` to compile.
