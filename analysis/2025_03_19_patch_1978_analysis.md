## First error

../../net/dns/address_sorter_posix_unittest.cc:299:10: error: cannot increment value of type 'base::span<const char *const>'
  299 |          ++addr) {
      |          ^ ~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying `char* const[]` variable used with `++` operator.

## Reason
The original code used a raw C-style array, which allowed incrementing the pointer to iterate through the array. After the rewrite, the `addresses` variable is now a `base::span<const char* const>`. The `++` operator is used in `for (base::span<const char* const> addr = addresses; addr[0] != nullptr;++addr)` to increment the span itself, which is not a valid operation since base::span is not designed to be used as a pointer replacement in this manner. Spans are not directly incrementable like raw pointers.

## Solution
The rewriter should identify cases where C-style arrays are used with the `++` increment operator. In these situations, the rewriter should avoid applying spanification, and ideally emit a warning instead to alert developers of the incompatibility. Specifically the rewriter should detect expressions like ++addr where addr is a spanified C-style array.
## Note
The spanification is also incorrect because it prevents iterating through the span, given the initial assignment of `addresses` to span and conditional `addr[0] != nullptr`, thus producing different runtime behavior.
