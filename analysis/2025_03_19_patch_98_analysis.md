## First error
../../chrome/browser/push_messaging/push_messaging_app_identifier.cc:24:31: error: redefinition of 'kPushMessagingAppIdentifierPrefix' with a different type: 'const std::array<char, 4>' vs 'const char[]'

## Category
Rewriter dropped mutable qualifier.

## Reason
The original code has `extern const char kPushMessagingAppIdentifierPrefix[];` in the header file. This means that the variable `kPushMessagingAppIdentifierPrefix` has external linkage.
The rewriter arrayified this variable, but when it arrayified it, it created a local definition. But this variable has external linkage and was already defined. The rewriter effectively created a redefinition. To fix this, the rewriter needs to rewrite the original declaration/definition to `std::array` instead of creating a new one.
The other errors are consequences of this first error.

## Solution
The rewriter should rewrite the original declaration of `kPushMessagingAppIdentifierPrefix` in `chrome/browser/push_messaging/push_messaging_app_identifier.h` from `extern const char kPushMessagingAppIdentifierPrefix[];` to `extern const std::array<char, 4> kPushMessagingAppIdentifierPrefix;`. Also it should rewrite the implementation file.

## Note
```
Overlapping replacements due to multiple variable declaration.
