# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_173

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webaudio/cpu/x86/oscillator_kernel_sse2.cc:154:9: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'const __m128i *' to 'base::span<const __m128i, 1>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the variable `r1`, but in doing so, it introduced a `reinterpret_cast` that caused a compilation error. The original code might have been valid because it was casting between compatible pointer types. However, when creating a span, one should generally avoid `reinterpret_cast` to ensure type safety and avoid undefined behavior. In this case, the `__m128i` type has special memory layout requirement enforced by compiler with attributes. Casting it to `uint32_t` is not valid.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid creating the span if it involves a `reinterpret_cast`. Instead, the rewriter should not spanify this code.

## Note
The second error is a direct result of the first error.
