# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1348

## First error

third_party/blink/renderer/core/xml/xpath_grammar_generated.h:1453:35: error: expected expression
 1453 |     const std::array<signed char, > yydefact_;
      |                                   ^

## Category
Rewriter cannot get the size of forward declared array variable.

## Reason
The rewriter encountered a forward-declared array (`yydefact_`) within the class `XPathGrammar`, so it was unable to determine the array size and generated `std::array<signed char, >`. The size of the array is missing in the `std::array` instantiation.

## Solution
The rewriter should not try to arrayify a variable if it couldn't determine the size because it is a forward declaration.
