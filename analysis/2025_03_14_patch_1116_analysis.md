# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1116

## First error

third_party/blink/renderer/core/xml/xpath_grammar_generated.h:1432:35: error: expected expression
 1432 |     const std::array<signed char, > yypact_;
      |                                   ^

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter added `#include <array>` in a header file, but this header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition. The rewriter is attempting to make `yypact_` a `std::array` but failing to provide the size.

## Solution
The rewriter is including `<array>` unnecessarily, likely as a side effect of trying to spanify some code. The rewriter should detect this pattern and avoid adding the include if it causes syntax errors. Alternatively, the rewriter should avoid spanifying code in a way that causes the header to be transitively included in a class declaration.

## Note
The other errors are the result of the first error.
