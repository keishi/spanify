# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1241

## First error
Overlapping replacements: ./base/atomicops.cc at offset 1922, length 4294967295: "=src_byte_ptr.subspan()" and offset 2129, length 1: " "

## Category
Overlapping replacements between RewriteArraySizeof and AppendDataCall.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to create a span `src_byte_ptr` via subspan but overlaps the addition of `.data()` calls later on, resulting in overlapping replacements. The initial replacement for subspan is large (length 4294967295) and interferes with the attempt to rewrite accesses to add .data() to pointer expressions.

## Solution
Ensure that the rewriter does not create overly large initial replacements that could overlap with other necessary changes. The ranges of subspan replacements and data() replacements should be calculated more precisely to avoid overlaps. Consider splitting up the rewrite into smaller steps.

## Note
The original code:
```c++
const uint8_t* src_byte_ptr = src.data();
```
was converted into:
```c++
base::span<const uint8_t>src_byte_ptr = src;
```

The code also tries to rewrite
```c++
.store(*src_byte_ptr, std::memory_order_relaxed);
```
to
```c++
.store( src_byte_ptr[0], std::memory_order_relaxed);
```
It seems like the rewriter is unable to complete adding .data() at the end.
