# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1991

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code attempts to call `payload.subspan(payload_size)` in the constructor `WebMWebVTTParser`. `payload_size` is defined as `int`, but `subspan()` expects an argument of type `size_t` which is an unsigned type. The compiler fails to find a suitable `strict_cast` for the conversion from `int` to `size_t`.

## Solution
The rewriter should generate a `static_cast<size_t>(payload_size)` when rewriting the call to `subspan`.

## Note
The rewriter has other issues:
1. It incorrectly added `base/containers/span.h` in the header file. This should be in the `.cc` file.
2. It introduced an invalid comparison between a span and a raw_ptr ( `if (ptr_ >= ptr_end_)`).
3. It attempted to increment a span `ptr_++`.
4. It incorrectly used a `base::raw_span` instead of a raw_ptr for a member field that cannot be default constructed.
