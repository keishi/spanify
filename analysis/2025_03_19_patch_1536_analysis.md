# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1536

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code is calling `subspan` with an `int` index.  The `subspan` method takes a `size_t` as an argument for the offset. `size_t` is unsigned. The rewriter failed to insert an explicit cast from int to size_t (or some other unsigned integer type). The `strict_cast` call in StrictNumeric constructor requires that the source range is contained within the destination range. However, the range of int can be negative, which is outside the range of size_t, so strict_cast fails.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to ensure that the argument passed to `subspan()` is cast to the correct unsigned type, like `size_t` or `unsigned long`.

## Note
The rewriter changed this line

```
-    return schema_data_.required_properties + index;
+    return schema_data_.required_properties.subspan(index).data();
```

The `index` variable is an `int`.
```
const char* const* required_property(int index) const {
