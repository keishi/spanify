# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_451

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The rewriter needs to cast the argument to `base::span::subspan()` to an unsigned value. The error occurs because the `strict_cast` function in `safe_conversions.h` does not have a matching overload for converting an `int` to an `unsigned long` when the `kStaticDstRangeRelationToSrcRange<unsigned long, int>` is not `NumericRangeRepresentation::kContained`. In this case, it is likely failing because `sizeof(int)` is not less than or equal to `sizeof(unsigned long)`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to insert a `static_cast<size_t>` or `static_cast<unsigned long>` to convert the `int` argument to `subspan()` to the correct type. The chosen type depends on the argument type to subspan.

## Note
The rewriter also generated code that calculates the size of the data using `.size() * sizeof(decltype(kRequestData)::value_type))` which it is not needed for spans.

```
            (kRequestData.size() * sizeof(decltype(kRequestData)::value_type)) -
                4),
