# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_997

## First error

Overlapping replacements: /usr/local/google/home/nuskos/chromium-team/chromium/src/media/formats/mp4/box_reader_unittest.cc at offset 2600, length 16: "(kSkipBox.size() * sizeof(decltype(kSkipBox)::value_type))" and offset 2606, length 0: ".data()"

## Category
Overlapping replacements between RewriteArraySizeof and AppendDataCall.

## Reason
The rewriter attempts to perform two replacements that overlap. The first replacement rewrites `sizeof(kSkipBox)` as `(kSkipBox.size() * sizeof(decltype(kSkipBox)::value_type))`. The second replacement attempts to add `.data()` to `kSkipBox` which may have been triggered from the parameter in the `std::vector`. Because these two replacements overlap, the rewriter fails.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid generating overlapping replacements. This likely involves ensuring that only one replacement is generated for a given region of code or ensuring that the replacements are properly ordered to avoid conflicts.

## Note
The error message shows that the replacements overlap. This indicates that the rewriter is attempting to modify the same region of code multiple times in a conflicting manner.
