## First error

../../base/trace_event/trace_arguments_unittest.cc:290:7: error: reinterpret_cast from 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') to 'unsigned long long' is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The code attempts to reinterpret_cast a `std::string_view` to an `unsigned long long`. The spanify tool introduced `std::string_view` from a rewritten `kText` variable, however, `reinterpret_cast` on `string_view` to `unsigned long long` is not allowed. The function that calls this code should not be spanified because it uses excluded code (the third_party string_view).

## Solution
The spanify tool should avoid spanifying the `TraceArguments` constructor. The `TraceArguments` constructor is part of the `base` code. If it takes rewritten parameters, and also uses excluded third_party code like `string_view` then it can cause errors like these.

## Note
The second error indicates a missing namespace for `span`, which may be a consequence of including the `<string_view>` header. However, focus is on classifying the first error only.
