## First error

../../net/disk_cache/backend_unittest.cc:510:25: error: no viable conversion from 'std::array<char, 30>' to 'const std::string' (aka 'const basic_string<char>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast arrayified `char[]` variable used with std::string.

## Reason
The rewriter converted a `char[]` to `std::array<char, N>`, but is now passing that `std::array` directly to a function expecting a `std::string`. The compiler flags this as an invalid conversion. The rewriter needs to automatically add `.data()` to make this conversion valid.

## Solution
The rewriter should detect that an arrayified `char[]` variable is being used in a context expecting a `std::string`, and automatically add `.data()` to the variable.

In this specific case, the fix would be to change line 510 from:

```c++
ASSERT_THAT(OpenEntry(buffer, &entry2), IsOk());
```

to:

```c++
ASSERT_THAT(OpenEntry(buffer.data(), &entry2), IsOk());
```

## Note
The second error occurs on line 516 and 522, and it is the same error:

```
../../net/disk_cache/backend_unittest.cc:516:32: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('std::array<char, 30>' and 'int')
../../net/disk_cache/backend_unittest.cc:522:32: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('std::array<char, 30>' and 'int')
```

This error stems from the same root cause: using the arrayified variable with pointer arithmetic. In this case, it's `buffer + 1` where `buffer` is a `std::array`. The solution for that is to also call `.data()` first:

```c++
ASSERT_THAT(OpenEntry(buffer.data() + 1, &entry2), IsOk());
```

The third error is:

```
../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
```

This means that the rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.
