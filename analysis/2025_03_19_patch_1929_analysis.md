## First error
../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The rewriter is generating `subspan(1)` where the `1` is a signed integer literal, but the `subspan` function requires it to be an unsigned integer.

```c++
  constexpr span<T> subspan(size_t offset,
                            size_t count = dynamic_extent) const noexcept {
```

## Solution
The rewriter needs to cast argument to `base::span::subspan()` to an unsigned value to ensure that it matches the type of the parameter.

```c++
    destination = destination.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(1));
```

## Note
The other errors are likely follow-on effects of this initial type mismatch.
