# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_53

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code `dst = dst.subspan(cluster_a->bytes_used());` is causing a compile error because `cluster_a->bytes_used()` returns an `int`, but `base::span::subspan()` expects an unsigned type, and a safe conversion is not available. The compiler cannot implicitly convert the signed `int` to an unsigned type without a narrowing conversion that might lose data.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to insert a static_cast to `size_t` or `unsigned long` to explicitly convert the `int` to the expected unsigned type before calling `subspan()`.

```c++
dst = dst.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(cluster_a->bytes_used()));
```

## Note
The same error will occur on line 2082. So all three calls to subspan must be updated.
