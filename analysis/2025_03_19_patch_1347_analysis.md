# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1347

## First error

third_party/blink/renderer/core/xml/xpath_grammar_generated.h:1448:35: error: expected expression
1448 |     const std::array<signed char, > yypact_;
      |                                   ^

## Category
Rewriter cannot get the size of forward declared array variable.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to convert a C-style array to `std::array`, but it is encountering a forward declaration where the size of the array is not immediately available.  This prevents the rewriter from determining the necessary size parameter for the `std::array`. In this specific case, the class member `yypact_` is declared as `static const signed char yypact_[];` and later defined in the .cc file, so the rewriter doesn't know how large the array is when processing the header.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid arrayifying variables when the size cannot be determined at the point of declaration. One approach is to check if the variable declaration is a definition and only rewrite it when the size is explicit.

## Note
The other errors are follow-on errors from the initial problem. Specifically the line
`third_party/blink/renderer/core/xml/xpath_grammar_generated.cc:1796:13: error: non-static data member defined out-of-line`
is caused by the rewriter turning a `static const signed char yypact_[];` into `const std::array<signed char, > yypact_;` which requires in-class initialization.
