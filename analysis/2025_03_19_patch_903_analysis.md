# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_903

## First error

../../base/debug/dwarf_line_no.cc:237:45: error: cannot assign to return value because function 'operator[]' returns a const value
237 |           program_info->filename_offsets[0] = program_info->filename_offsets[1];
    |           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^

## Category
Rewriter dropped mutable qualifier.

## Reason
The rewriter replaced `mutable uint64_t filename_offsets[kMaxFilenames];` with `std::array<uint64_t, kMaxFilenames> filename_offsets;`. However, it failed to preserve the `mutable` qualifier. The code attempts to modify `filename_offsets` which is now implicitly const.

## Solution
The rewriter should preserve the `mutable` qualifier when rewriting array declarations to `std::array`. The corrected declaration should be `mutable std::array<uint64_t, kMaxFilenames> filename_offsets;`

## Note
The second error in the log is the same as the first, indicating that the same issue occurs in multiple places.
