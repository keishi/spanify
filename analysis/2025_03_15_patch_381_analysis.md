## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan()` method requires a size_t (unsigned) argument. In the provided code, the literal `3` is an integer, leading to a compilation error because `strict_cast` cannot convert a signed integer `3` to an unsigned `size_t` type.

## Solution
The rewriter should ensure that the argument to `subspan()` is explicitly cast to `size_t`. In cases where the argument is a literal, the rewriter needs to generate code to cast the argument using `static_cast<size_t>()`.

## Note
The error message `no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'` indicates that the compiler is unable to find a suitable overload of `strict_cast` to perform the conversion.
