# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_542

## First error

../../base/trace_event/trace_arguments.h:686:58: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'const std::array<unsigned char, kMaxSize>' to function return type 'const base::span<unsigned char>'

## Category
Rewriter failed to add implicit conversion to `base::span`.

## Reason
The rewriter changed the return type of `TraceArguments::types()` to `const base::span<unsigned char>`, but did not update the return statement to construct the span from the `types_` member.  The compiler is complaining that there is no implicit conversion from `const std::array<unsigned char, kMaxSize>` to `const base::span<unsigned char>`.

## Solution
The rewriter should update the return statement to return `base::span(types_)` instead of just `types_`.

## Note
None
