# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_199

## First error

../../content/browser/file_system/file_system_url_loader_factory_browsertest.cc:402:44: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The code attempts to call `subspan` on the return value of `data()`, which has been spanified. The rewriter failed to recognize that `data()` now returns a span and should rewrite the expression to call `data()` first and then apply `subspan` to the result.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be updated to properly handle chained calls where a function returning a span is immediately followed by another method call that expects a pointer.

The rewriter should transform:

```c++
kFileSystemURLPrefix.data().subspan(path)
```

into:

```c++
kFileSystemURLPrefix.data().data() + path
```

## Note
