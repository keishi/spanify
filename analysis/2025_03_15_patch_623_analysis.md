# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_15_patch_623

## First error

../../base/trace_event/trace_arguments.h:532:32: error: member reference base type 'char[1]' is not a structure or union
  532 |     return data_ ? data_->chars.data() : nullptr;
      |                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to add .data() to arrayified `char[]` variable used with std::span.

## Reason
The code attempts to access the `data()` member of `data_->chars`, which is now a `std::array<char, N>`. The `.data()` method was not added to this access which is needed to obtain the raw pointer. The code `return data_ ? data_->chars.data() : nullptr;` should have been rewritten to `return data_ ? data_->chars.data() : nullptr;`.

## Solution
The rewriter should add the `.data()` call when accessing `data_->chars` member in third_party code to convert the `std::array` to `char*`.

## Note
Other errors are secondary effects of the missing .data() call on the `chars` member.
