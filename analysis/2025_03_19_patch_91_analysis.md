# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_91

## First error

../../chrome/browser/signin/dice_web_signin_interceptor.cc:426:70: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
  426 |       kChromeSingInInterceptionSupervisionStateHistogramPrefix.data().subspan(
      |       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The code attempts to call `.subspan()` on the result of `.data()`, where `.data()` was a spanified `char[]` that was converted to `std::array`.

```c++
kChromeSingInInterceptionSupervisionStateHistogramPrefix.data().subspan(...)
```

Since `.data()` returns a span, the rewriter should've rewritten it to:

```c++
base::span<char>::subspan(...)
```

But it failed to do so.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to handle the case where a subspan method is called on the return value of a `.data()` method from a spanified array.

## Note
The error is happening in the following file and line:

`chrome/browser/signin/dice_web_signin_interceptor.cc:426:70`
