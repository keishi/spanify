# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1591

## First error

../../ui/events/keycodes/dom/keycode_converter.cc:164:10: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'const KeycodeMapEntry[246]' to function return type 'const base::span<KeycodeMapEntry>'

## Category
Rewriter failed to add .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The function `GetKeycodeMapForTest()` is changed to return `base::span<KeycodeMapEntry>`, but the return statement doesn't create the span object correctly. The rewriter needs to create a span from the C-style array, likely using `base::make_span(kDomCodeMappings, kDomCodeMappingsSize)`.  Because `kDomCodeMappings` was not converted to std::array, it will decay to a pointer. Thus it cannot be directly converted to span.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize the pattern of returning a C-style array where it should return a span. Replace `return kDomCodeMappings;` with `return base::make_span(kDomCodeMappings);`.

## Note
There is a similar issue at ui/events/keycodes/dom/keycode_converter_unittest.cc.
