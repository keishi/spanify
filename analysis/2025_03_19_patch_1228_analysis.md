## First error

../../base/trace_event/trace_event_unittest.cc:260:43: error: member reference type 'base::span<const JsonKeyValue>' is not a pointer; did you mean to use '.'?

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The original code had a pointer `key_values` that was dereferenced using `->` to access the `key` member. The rewriter converted this pointer to a `base::span`, which is not a pointer type, so the `->` operator is no longer valid. The correct operator to use is `.`. This suggests the rewriter should not generate `key_values->key` when spanifying `key_values`.

## Solution
The rewriter should not add `->` if spanifying a variable to `base::span`. The rewriter logic should be able to remove `->` and replace with `.` if necessary.

## Note
The other errors are secondary and are caused by the first error.
