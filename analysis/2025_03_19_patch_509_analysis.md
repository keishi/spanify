## First error

../../ui/gfx/color_space_unittest.cc:115:20: error: suggest braces around initialization of subobject [-Werror,-Wmissing-braces]
  115 |                   {235.f / 255.f, 239.5f / 255.f, 239.5f / 255.f, 1.0000f},

      |                    {                                                     }

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The compiler is complaining about missing braces in the initialization of a `SkV4` object within a multi-dimensional array. This is because the rewriter has likely converted `SkV4 expected_yuvs[kNumColorSpaces][kNumBitDepths][kNumTestYUVs]` to `std::array` but the initialization format is incorrect for `std::array`. The correct initialization syntax for a nested `std::array` involves using braces `{}` to delimit each sub-array.

## Solution
The rewriter should only perform spanification/arrayification rewrite and shouldn't change code in unrelated manner. The rewriter must have added the conversion to `std::array` without ensuring the initialization is compatible.

## Note
The compiler is also throwing "excess elements in struct initializer" errors later in the build log, indicating the rewriter has introduced a secondary error where the array initialization has an incorrect number of elements.
