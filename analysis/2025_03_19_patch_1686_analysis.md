## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
`subspan` is being called with an integer literal `5`. `strict_cast` in
`base::numerics::SafeConversions` doesn't allow casting a signed integer to an
unsigned value.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to cast the argument to `subspan` to an unsigned value to avoid the
`strict_cast` error, for example, `static_cast<size_t>(5)`.

## Note
None
