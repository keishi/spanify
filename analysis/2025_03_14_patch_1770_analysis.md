## First error

../../base/trace_event/trace_arguments.h:687:56: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'const std::array<const char *, kMaxSize>' to function return type 'const base::span<char* const>'
  687 |   const base::span<char* const> names() const { return names_; }
      |                                                        ^~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to support conversion from std::array<const char*> to base::span<char* const>

## Reason
The rewriter changed `const char* names_[kMaxSize];` to `std::array<const char*, kMaxSize> names_;`. At the same time it changed the return type `const char* const* names() const` to `const base::span<char* const> names() const`. It is not possible to convert `std::array<const char*, kMaxSize>` to  `base::span<char* const>`, because the char type is different between `const char*` and `char* const`. It is trying to return an immutable array as a mutable span, which is not allowed. This is because the elements of the array are `const char*`, but the span expects `char* const`.

## Solution
There are several possible solutions:

1.  Change the declaration of `names_` to `std::array<char* const, kMaxSize> names_;`
2.  Cast the `names_` to `base::span<char* const>` in the return statement, e.g., `return base::span<char* const>(const_cast<char* const*>(names_.data()), names_.size());`
3.  Keep the original type, `const char* names_[kMaxSize]` and construct a `base::span` from it.
4.  Change the return type to `base::span<const char* const>`.

Option 4 seems to be the safest option in terms of not introducing other issues. The best solution is to change return type.

## Note
The other errors in the log are likely caused by this first error.
