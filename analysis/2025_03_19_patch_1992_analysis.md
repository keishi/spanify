# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1992

## First error

../../media/formats/webm/webm_webvtt_parser_unittest.cc:32:7: error: reinterpret_cast from 'const std::string' (aka 'const basic_string<char>') to 'const uint8_t *' (aka 'const unsigned char *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter has spanified the variable `result` (which is a `std::string`) but left a `reinterpret_cast` that is applied to it. This cast from `const std::string` to `const uint8_t*` is now invalid because the rewriter introduced a `std::array` in the code and `result` is no longer a raw array. The rewriter should have removed the `reinterpret_cast` when spanifying.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be able to identify reinterpret_casts applied to spanified variables and replace them with `.data()` to keep the casts valid.

## Note
The generated code now has `buf.subspan(result.length()).data()` in the return statement, this means the return type also needs to be spanified to accommodate the new return statement.
