## First error

../../remoting/protocol/connection_unittest.cc:222:38: error: reinterpret_cast from 'std::vector<char>' to 'const int16_t *' (aka 'const short *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter has spanified `data_` to `base::span<char>` but left a reinterpret_cast that is applied to it. The rewriter needs to be able to remove the reinterpret_cast or handle it properly.

## Solution
The rewriter should either remove the reinterpret_cast or transform the code so the code compiles with the spanified variable. The easy way to handle this would be to rewrite the `data()` call with a subspan with the proper sizes/types.

## Note
None
