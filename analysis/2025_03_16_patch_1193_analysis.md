# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_16_patch_1193

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webcodecs/audio_data.cc:664:39: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<uint8_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned char>') to 'int32_t *' (aka 'int *') is not allowed
  664 |       base::span<int32_t> dest_data = reinterpret_cast<int32_t*>(dest);

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast with span.

## Reason
The code attempts to create a `base::span<int32_t>` from a `base::span<uint8_t>` using `reinterpret_cast`. This is not allowed because `base::span` is designed to provide type safety, and `reinterpret_cast` bypasses this safety. The original code likely used a raw pointer in place of `base::span`, which allowed the `reinterpret_cast`. After the rewriter changed `dest_data` to a span, the `reinterpret_cast` became invalid. The rewriter should have either left the underlying variable as a raw pointer or used a safe method to create the span.

## Solution
The rewriter should use `as_bytes` and `reinterpret_cast` to perform the conversion safely, i.e. create a `span<byte>` and then reinterpret_cast to the destination span.

## Note
The build failure occurs in `../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webcodecs/audio_data.cc` which is part of the blink code.
