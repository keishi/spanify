# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1940

## First error

../../storage/common/file_system/file_system_util.cc:34:24: error: redefinition of 'kTestDir' with a different type: 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') vs 'const char[]'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid replacing with `std::string_view` since it is an export variable in the header file.

## Reason
The `kTestDir` variable is declared as `extern const char kTestDir[];` in the header file `file_system_util.h`, indicating it is an external variable with a C-style string type.
The rewriter is replacing the type of `kTestDir` with `std::string_view` within the `file_system_util.cc` file.
This causes a redefinition error since the type declared in the source file must match the type declared in the header file when using `extern`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to avoid directly changing the type of variables declared with `extern`. Instead it needs to handle the `base::span` conversion of a `const char[]` type to `const std::string_view` correctly or use the underlying character array directly. This can happen if the variable being assigned to is known to be a span. 

For the case found, given that both are string-like, replacing the original `+` with llvm::format's `%s` would fix it.

## Note
The rewriter also failed to convert `kTestDir` to a base::span.
```
../../storage/common/file_system/file_system_util.cc:227:15: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'const char[]' to 'base::span<const char>'
  227 |       url += (base::span<const char>(kTestDir)
```
This seems to be happening because span does not understand raw C arrays and decays.
