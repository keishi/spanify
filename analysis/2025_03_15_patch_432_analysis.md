# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_15_patch_432

## First error

../../components/feedback/feedback_report.cc:67:69: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The code attempts to call `subspan` on the return of `kFeedbackReportFilenamePrefix.data()`. However the `data()` function is part of std::array, so is excluded from spanification.

## Solution
The rewriter should not call `subspan` on the return of data from standard library objects. Rewriting that part of the line would require the rewriter to replace `kFeedbackReportFilenamePrefix.data()` with `"Feedback Report."`

## Note
No other errors are present in the log.
