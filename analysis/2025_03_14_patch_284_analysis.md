# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_284

## First error

../../chrome/browser/bookmarks/bookmark_html_writer_unittest.cc:69:24: error: no viable conversion from 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<uint32_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned int>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying return value of third_party function where resulting span is not compatible.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to directly assign a `uint32_t*` returned from `bmp.getAddr32()` to a `base::span<uint32_t>`. This fails because the `base::span` constructor requires a compatible range, and a raw pointer isn't automatically considered a compatible range without additional information about its size. The root cause is that the `bmp.getAddr32` is a third party function call and the return type must not be directly assigned to span without explicitly providing the size of the underlying buffer.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of the third_party function, but must account for raw pointers lacking an inherent size. Since the returned pointer is from third party code, the rewriter must introduce `base::span` with explicit cast of pointer and its extent, with a safety comment. In this case, it is possible to deduce the size using width and height of the bitmap.

```c++
base::span<uint32_t> src_data(bmp.getAddr32(0, 0), bmp.width() * bmp.height()); //  Safe as bitmap is a valid memory range.
```

## Note
The other solution would be to not spanify this location, but this is not the proper way to handle the problem.
