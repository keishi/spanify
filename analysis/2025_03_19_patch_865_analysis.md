# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_865

## First error

../../build/linux/debian_bullseye_amd64-sysroot/usr/include/string.h:28:1: error: expected member name or ';' after declaration specifiers
   28 | __BEGIN_DECLS

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter is adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_autogen.h`. But this header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition in `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface.h`.

## Solution
The rewriter should not add `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_autogen.h`.

## Note
The `gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h` file is generated code, so it is excluded from the rewriter. Thus we shouldn't spanify functions that require rewriting excluded code. See Existing categories.

The same problem appears in `<../../build/linux/debian_bullseye_amd64-sysroot/usr/include/wchar.h>`.

The error message `../../third_party/llvm-build/Release+Asserts/lib/clang/21/include/__stddef_size_t.h:18:23: error: redefinition of 'size_t'` means that size_t has been multiply defined. This means that some of the headers are not properly guarded.

The error message `../../third_party/libc++/src/include/__algorithm/find.h:49:14: error: no member named '__invoke' in namespace 'gpu::gles2::std'` means that some namespaces are not properly opened or closed.
