# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1412

## First error

../../chrome/browser/autocomplete/search_provider_unittest.cc:3205:13: error: suggest braces around initialization of subobject [-Werror,-Wmissing-braces]
 3205 |           {{"a", false, AutocompleteMatchType::SEARCH_WHAT_YOU_TYPED, false},
      |             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      |             {                                                               }

## Category
Rewriter dropped mutable qualifier.

## Reason
The rewriter changed `const Match matches[5];` to `const std::array<Match, 5> matches;`. The initialization of the array requires additional braces around the subobjects to properly construct the `Match` objects within the `std::array`. The original code relied on implicit conversions and aggregate initialization which is different than the arrayified version.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize that it is arrayifying a `Match` object which requires explicit initialization and add additional braces `{}` around the individual objects. The fix is to change:
```c++
     const std::array<Match, 5> matches;
   } cases[] = {
       // Default provider response does not have prefetch details. Ensure that
       // the suggestions are not marked as prefetch query.
           {{"a", false, AutocompleteMatchType::SEARCH_WHAT_YOU_TYPED, false},
```
to
```c++
     const std::array<Match, 5> matches;
   } cases[] = {
       // Default provider response does not have prefetch details. Ensure that
       // the suggestions are not marked as prefetch query.
           {{{"a", false, AutocompleteMatchType::SEARCH_WHAT_YOU_TYPED, false},
```

## Note
The other 7 errors in the build log appear to be the same error repeated.
