# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1098

## First error

../../media/mojo/mojom/stable/stable_video_decoder_types_mojom_traits_unittest.cc:133:33: error: no member named 'subspan' in 'std::array<unsigned int, 4>'
  133 |           kInvalidSpatialLayers.subspan(kLayersSize).data()));
      |           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^

## Category
Rewriter needs to check for the existence of subspan() method before adding it.

## Reason
The code is using `std::array`, which does not have a `subspan()` method. The rewriter should only add `.subspan()` if the object has the subspan method.

## Solution
The rewriter should use `hasMember()` matcher to check if the subspan method exists.

## Note
Rewriter failed to add `.data()` to the std::array in a call to assign. This is a secondary error, but it likely would have been caught in future builds.
