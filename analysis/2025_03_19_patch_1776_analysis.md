# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1776

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/service/program_manager_unittest.cc:1540:5: error: no viable conversion from 'const array<remove_cv_t<int>, 2UL>' (aka 'const array<int, 2UL>') to 'const GLint *' (aka 'const int *')
 1540 |     kBlockIndex,
      |     ^~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The error indicates a type mismatch. The code expects a `const GLint*` but is receiving a `const std::array<GLint, 2>`. This likely happened because the rewriter attempted to convert `kBlockIndex` to `std::array` but the function where `kBlockIndex` was used was not properly updated to handle `std::array`.

The rewriter should not attempt to spanify/arrayify `kBlockIndex` if the function call site is excluded from rewriting.  In this specific case, the test file is surrounded by `#ifdef UNSAFE_BUFFERS_BUILD` and `#pragma allow_unsafe_buffers`, so it should be skipped.

## Solution
Modify the rewriter to avoid rewriting variables that are used in code sections excluded by `#ifdef` blocks or other mechanisms. The rewriter should detect that the surrounding block is excluded from rewriting and skip the rewrite.
