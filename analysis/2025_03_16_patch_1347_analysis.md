From the file contents, `icu::UnicodeString` and `getBuffer` come from the third party library ICU. Since `icu::UnicodeString` is third party code, the rewriter shouldn't be modifying this code.

To fix this, the code should be reverted to the original code.

```c++
  icu::UnicodeString host_alt(host);
  size_t length = host_alt.length();
  char16_t* buffer = host_alt.getBuffer(-1);
  for (char16_t* uc = buffer + src_pos; uc < buffer + length; ++uc) {
    if (*uc == src_char) {
      *uc = mapped_char;
    }
  }
  host_alt.releaseBuffer(length);
```

Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The code is attempting to call `base::span::subspan` on a variable that's been assigned the result of `host_alt.getBuffer(-1)`. The return of `host_alt.getBuffer(-1)` can't be converted to `base::span` so the code is failing. Rewriting the line `char16_t* buffer = host_alt.getBuffer(-1)` to `base::span<char16_t> buffer = host_alt.getBuffer(-1)` is not a valid rewrite because the `getBuffer` function comes from a third party library, so spanifying this function call would require spanifying third party code.

## Solution
The rewriter should detect these situations and avoid spanifying the function to prevent errors.

## Note
The second error in the log is related to incrementing a span, which is not allowed.

```
../../components/url_formatter/spoof_checks/skeleton_generator.cc:258:37: error: cannot increment value of type 'base::span<char16_t>'
  258 |        uc < buffer.subspan(length); ++uc) {
      |                                     ^ ~~
```

This was caused by this line `++uc` which is also trying to increment a `base::span` iterator type.
