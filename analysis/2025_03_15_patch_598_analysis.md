# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_15_patch_598

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The rewriter is spanifying `UsbMidiDescriptorParser::ParseInternal` and when
the code is built an error `no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'` arises.
This is because `current[0]` is an `unsigned char` and thus it needs to be casted to
`size_t`.

```c++
  for (base::span<const uint8_t> current = data; current < data.subspan(size);
       current = current.subspan(current)[0]) {
```

## Solution
The fix is to add a cast to `size_t` in the loop.

```c++
  for (base::span<const uint8_t> current = data; current < data.subspan(size);
       current = current.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(current)[0])) {
```

## Note
There is also a secondary error that is resolved with the fix.
```
