# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_309

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/fonts/shaping/shape_cache.h:69:7: error: no matching function for call to object of type 'const __copy'
   69 |       std::ranges::copy(characters, characters_);
      |       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to support std::ranges::copy with std::array.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `UChar characters_[kCapacity];` to `std::array<UChar, kCapacity> characters_;`. However, the code uses `std::ranges::copy(characters, characters_);` which expects iterators. The spanified return value `data()` cannot be used with the ranges algorithm.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to transform `std::ranges::copy(characters, characters_);` to `std::ranges::copy(characters.begin(), characters.end(), characters_);`
when the destination is `std::array`.

## Note
The second error is:
```
../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/fonts/shaping/shape_cache.h:85:41: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('const std::array<UChar, kCapacity>' (aka 'const array<char16_t, kCapacity>') and 'const unsigned int')
   85 |       return UNSAFE_BUFFERS(characters_ + length_);
      |                             ~~~~~~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~
```

This is because spanifying `UChar characters_[kCapacity]` replaced the plus operator that is compatible with a C style array, but is not with std::array.

The rewriter failed to add `.data()` after the `characters_`.
