## First error

../../components/autofill/core/browser/geo/country_data.cc:320:38: error: no viable conversion from 'const char *const *' to 'base::span<const char *const>'
  320 |   for (base::span<const char* const> country_pointer =
      |                                      ^
  321 |            icu::Locale::getISOCountries();

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a C-style array.

## Reason
`icu::Locale::getISOCountries()` returns a C-style array: `const char* const*`. The rewriter tried to use it to initialize a `base::span<const char* const> country_pointer`. However, a C-style array is not automatically convertible to a span.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate code to explicitly construct a span from the returned C-style array by taking the pointer and adding a size. Since this array is null terminated use base::make_span and provide both begin and end:

```c++
for (base::span<const char* const> country_pointer =
           base::make_span(icu::Locale::getISOCountries(), []() {
             const char* const* ptr = icu::Locale::getISOCountries();
             while (*ptr) {
               ++ptr;
             }
             return ptr;
           }());
       country_pointer[0]; UNSAFE_BUFFERS(++country_pointer)) {
```

This is not trivial as it requires additional code to compute the end of the array.

## Note
The second error is that span doesn't support `++` operator. But this is only triggered after the first error is fixed. Ideally we could rewrite the loop to use indexed access.
```c++
for (size_t i = 0; icu::Locale::getISOCountries()[i]; ++i)
