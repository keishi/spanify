## First error

../../chrome/browser/autocomplete/search_provider_unittest.cc:3100:13: error: suggest braces around initialization of subobject [-Werror,-Wmissing-braces]
 3100 |           {{"x", "", "", "x", AutocompleteMatchType::SEARCH_WHAT_YOU_TYPED},
      |             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      |             {                                                             }

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The compiler is complaining about missing braces in the initialization of a `std::array`. This likely indicates the rewriter is trying to use `std::array` but the initialization is not compatible with its structure. Specifically, the rewriter likely created an `std::array` of `Match` structs, but the initialization syntax is still using C-style initialization without the required braces around the `Match` objects. It seems like `Match` is also excluded, which is what leads to the error.

## Solution
The rewriter should not attempt to rewrite this code because it requires rewriting the `Match` struct which is not allowed. The rewriter should avoid rewriting functions if it requires rewriting excluded code.

## Note
The other errors are all related to the first one.
