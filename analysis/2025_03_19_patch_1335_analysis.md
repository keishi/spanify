## First error

../../chrome/browser/download/download_target_determiner_unittest.cc:555:36: error: out-of-line definition of 'RunTestCasesWithActiveItem' does not match any declaration in '(anonymous namespace)::DownloadTargetDeterminerTest'
  555 | void DownloadTargetDeterminerTest::RunTestCasesWithActiveItem(
      |                                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `RunTestCasesWithActiveItem` was spanified, but the call sites were not spanified, causing a type mismatch. The function signature is expecting a `base::span<const DownloadTestCase>` argument, but the call sites are passing `const DownloadTestCase*` instead.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to spanify the call sites when spanifying the function declaration.

## Note
There are several other call sites that need to be updated, indicating that the rewriter consistently failed to update this function's call sites.
