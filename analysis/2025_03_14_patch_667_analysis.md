## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan` method requires an unsigned integer as an argument. The code passes `size - num_id_bytes`, which is a signed integer that can be negative, thus leading to an error during compilation because there is no implicit conversion from a negative signed int to an unsigned int.

## Solution
The rewriter should cast the signed integer to `static_cast<size_t>` before passing it as an argument to `subspan`. The rewriter should be updated to generate `static_cast<size_t>(size - num_id_bytes)`.

## Note
Several files are affected by this error in the patch.
