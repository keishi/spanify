# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1408

## First error

../../chrome/browser/apps/platform_apps/platform_app_launch.cc:150:18: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
  150 |                  .subspan(app_id));
      |                  ^~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
`chrome::kChromeUIAppsWithForceInstalledDeprecationDialogURL` was converted to a `std::array`, and the `.data()` method was correctly added to access the underlying character array. However, the rewriter then attempted to call `.subspan()` on the result of `.data()`. Since `.data()` returns a raw pointer (`const char*`), it does not have a `.subspan()` method. The rewriter incorrectly assumed that the return type of `.data()` would be a `base::span` and thus allow a `subspan` call.

## Solution
The rewriter should be updated to correctly handle the `.subspan()` call, so the correct fix should look like this: `base::StringPiece(kChromeUIAppsWithForceInstalledDeprecationDialogURL).substr(...)`. The `.substr()` function works on `base::StringPiece` and `std::string`, so it can handle both types after the rewrite.

## Note
This error pattern is present multiple times in the build log.
