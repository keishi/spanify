# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1552

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The error occurs because `base::span::subspan()` requires an unsigned value as its argument, but the rewriter did not generate the necessary code to cast the argument to an unsigned type. The build log shows the code failing during the initialization of StrictNumeric with a signed integer where an unsigned is expected.

## Solution
The rewriter should insert a `static_cast<size_t>()` or `static_cast<unsigned int>()` before calling subspan in cases like this, ensuring that the argument is explicitly cast to the expected unsigned type.

For example, the line:

```c++
base::span<const GLuint>(fb_ids).subspan(1).data()
```

should be changed to:

```c++
base::span<const GLuint>(fb_ids).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(1)).data()
