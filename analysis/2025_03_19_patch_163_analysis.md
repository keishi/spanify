# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_163

## First error

../../ui/gfx/skbitmap_operations_unittest.cc:77:27: error: no viable conversion from 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<SkPMColor>' (aka 'span<unsigned int>')
   77 |     base::span<SkPMColor> tinted_pixels = shifted.getAddr32(0, y);
      |                           ^               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The third_party function `SkBitmap::getAddr32` returns a `uint32_t*`. The rewriter is attempting to assign the result directly to a `base::span<SkPMColor>`. Since `SkPMColor` is an alias of `uint32_t`, the types are compatible, but it still needs to construct a `base::span`. However the rewriter doesn't know the size of the `SkBitmap` so it can't create the `span` properly.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate code to explicitly construct the span from the raw pointer. Since the size information is unavailable, a user fill placeholder is needed.

```diff
-   base::span<SkPMColor> tinted_pixels = shifted.getAddr32(0, y);
+   base::span<SkPMColor> tinted_pixels =
+       base::span<SkPMColor>(shifted.getAddr32(0, y), <# size #>);
```

## Note
The SkBitmap::getAddr32() function is third_party code.
