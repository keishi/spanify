# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1680

## First error

```
../../third_party/blink/renderer/core/layout/inline/inline_break_token.h:155:24: error: expected expression
  155 |   std::array<RareData, > rare_data_;
      |                        ^
```

## Category
Rewriter cannot get the size of forward declared array variable.

## Reason
The rewriter is trying to change `RareData rare_data_[];` to `std::array<RareData, > rare_data_;`. However, it cannot determine the size of the array because it is a trailing array member and the size is not explicitly defined. Therefore, it fails to generate the correct code for `std::array`.

## Solution
The rewriter should either not rewrite trailing arrays or determine a way to get the array size at this stage. This is likely difficult because the size is determined by a flag and not necessarily a constant.

## Note
N/A
