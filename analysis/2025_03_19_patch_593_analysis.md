# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_593

## First error

../../components/gwp_asan/crash_handler/crash_handler_unittest.cc:158:66: error: no viable conversion from 'crashpad::SanitizationAllowedMemoryRanges::Range *' to 'base::span<crashpad::SanitizationAllowedMemoryRanges::Range>'

## Category
Rewriter does not handle assignment of spanified variable from an allocation using new.

## Reason
The rewriter is trying to assign `new crashpad::SanitizationAllowedMemoryRanges::Range[memory_ranges.size()]` to a `base::span<crashpad::SanitizationAllowedMemoryRanges::Range>` variable, which is not a valid conversion. The error occurs because `new crashpad::SanitizationAllowedMemoryRanges::Range[memory_ranges.size()]` returns a raw pointer to the allocated memory, not a `base::span`.

## Solution
The code should use a container with ownership like `std::unique_ptr` or `std::vector`.

## Note
The secondary error is caused by using `reinterpret_cast` on the spanified variable, which is incorrect. The rewriter should avoid using `reinterpret_cast` on spanified variable.
