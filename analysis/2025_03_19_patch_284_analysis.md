# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_284

## First error

../../ipc/ipc_param_traits.h:22:17: error: static assertion failed due to requirement 'internal::AlwaysFalse<std::array<gfx::BufferFormat, 6>>::value': Cannot find the IPC::ParamTraits specialization. Did you forget to include the corresponding header file?

## Category
Rewriter needs to add necessary includes for spanified variables.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `gfx::BufferFormat buffer_formats_[kConfigCount];` to `std::array<gfx::BufferFormat, kConfigCount> buffer_formats_;`. But the rewriter forgot to include the required header file so that `IPC::ParamTraits` could be properly specialized to handle `std::array<gfx::BufferFormat, 6>`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to add `#include "ipc/param_traits.h"` to `ui/gfx/ipc/color/gfx_param_traits.cc` to make it compile.

## Note
There were no other errors.
