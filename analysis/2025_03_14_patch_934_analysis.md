# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_934

## First error

../../mojo/core/data_pipe_unittest.cc:1598:24: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'MojoHandle *' (aka 'unsigned long *') to 'base::span<MojoHandle, 1>' (aka 'span<unsigned long, 1>')

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `ReadEmptyMessageWithHandles` has been spanified to take a `base::span<MojoHandle>` as a parameter. However, at the call site in `DataPipeTest::SendProducer`, a raw pointer `&producer_` is being passed in, which is not implicitly convertible to `base::span<MojoHandle, 1>`. This is a failure to update the call site after the function signature was changed to use `base::span`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to ensure that call sites are properly updated when a function parameter is spanified. Specifically, it must wrap raw pointers with `base::span<Type, Size>` to create a span from the raw pointer when necessary.

In this case, update the following line:
```c++
ReadEmptyMessageWithHandles(pipe1, &producer_, 1))
```
to
```c++
ReadEmptyMessageWithHandles(pipe1, base::span<MojoHandle, 1>(&producer_), 1))
```

## Note
The same error occurs in several other call sites for `ReadEmptyMessageWithHandles` inside `mojo/core/data_pipe_unittest.cc`. Those call sites must also be updated:
- mojo/core/data_pipe_unittest.cc:1670
- mojo/core/data_pipe_unittest.cc:1924
- mojo/core/data_pipe_unittest.cc:1950
- mojo/core/data_pipe_unittest.cc:1983
