# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_972

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The rewriter generated code `buffer = buffer.subspan(transfered)` where `transfered` is a `ssize_t` which is a signed integer type (long). However, the subspan function expects an unsigned integer type. There is no implicit conversion between signed and unsigned integer types, so the rewriter needs to explicitly cast the argument.

## Solution
The rewriter should cast the argument to `subspan` to an unsigned integer type. For example:

```c++
buffer = buffer.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(transfered));
```

## Note
The other errors are likely caused by rewriting `char[]` to `base::span<char>`, but failing to handle the `.size()` and `.data()` calls. Rewriting `char[]` is not always the right thing to do.
