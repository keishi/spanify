# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_274

## First error
../../base/memory/scoped_refptr.h:151:16: error: no matching constructor for initialization of 'media::AudioBuffer'

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `AudioBuffer::CopyBitstreamFrom` was spanified, but the call site `media_type_converters.cc` was not updated correctly. Specifically, the call site was constructing the span incorrectly with `&data` instead of passing `data`. This caused a type mismatch because the span now expects an array of pointers, instead of a pointer.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to correctly update all call sites of spanified functions.

In `media/mojo/common/media_type_converters.cc`, change:
```c++
-        input->sample_rate, input->frame_count, &data, input->data.size(),
+        input->sample_rate, input->frame_count, base::span<uint8_t*, 1>(&data), input->data.size(),
```
to:
```c++
-        input->sample_rate, input->frame_count, &data, input->data.size(),
+        input->sample_rate, input->frame_count, base::make_span(&data, 1), input->data.size(),
```

## Note
This build failure revealed a call site that was not correctly spanified. The rewriter should correctly recognize raw pointer passed to spanified functions.
