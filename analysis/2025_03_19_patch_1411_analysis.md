# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1411

## First error

../../chrome/browser/autocomplete/search_provider_unittest.cc:3100:13: error: suggest braces around initialization of subobject [-Werror,-Wmissing-braces]

## Category
Rewriter dropped mutable qualifier.

## Reason
The rewriter changed `Match matches[5];` to `std::array<Match, 5> matches;`. The `Match` struct may have a mutable member. By converting to `std::array`, it lost the mutable qualifier.

## Solution
Add `mutable` before the array definition in the `cases` struct.

## Note
There are additional errors about excess elements in struct initializer, which are related to the first error.
