# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_16_patch_1440

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webaudio/oscillator_handler.cc:501:19: error: no matching member function for call to 'WaveDataForFundamentalFrequency'

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `PeriodicWave::WaveDataForFundamentalFrequency` expects a `float*&` as its second argument, but the rewriter spanified `OscillatorHandler::ProcessKRate` to use a `base::span<float>` called `lower_wave_data`. Because the `WaveDataForFundamentalFrequency` function was not also spanified, there is a mismatch in the argument type.

## Solution
The correct solution is to spanify PeriodicWave::WaveDataForFundamentalFrequency and all its callers.

## Note
The rewriter also failed in DoInterpolation because it requires the lower_wave_data as base::span<const float>.
