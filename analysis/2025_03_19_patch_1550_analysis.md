# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1550

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code uses `base::span<const GLuint>(tx_ids).subspan(1).data()`. The `subspan` method returns a `base::span`. The `.data()` method of `base::span` is then called to get a raw pointer. The rewriter automatically adds `.data()` to this call, but it fails to cast the result to unsigned, leading to compilation error. This is because `1` is an `int` and `subspan()` requires an unsigned integer type such as `size_t`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to explicitly cast the argument to `subspan` to `size_t` when a function parameter expects an unsigned value.

```c++
      base::span<const GLuint>(tx_ids).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(1)).data(),
```
