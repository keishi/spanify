# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_16_patch_160

## First error

../../build/linux/debian_bullseye_amd64-sysroot/usr/include/string.h:28:1: error: expected member name or ';' after declaration specifiers

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter is adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_autogen.h`. But this header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` inside header files that will transitively include system headers that will be wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. A possible solution is to use forward declarations instead of including the header in the header files.

## Note
The error also shows multiple redefinition errors related to `size_t`, which are likely caused by the same issue of including system headers in an invalid context.
