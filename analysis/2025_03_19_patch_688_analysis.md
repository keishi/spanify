## First error

../../chrome/browser/serial/serial_chooser_context.cc:79:37: error: reinterpret_cast from 'std::string' (aka 'basic_string<char>') to 'const uint64_t *' (aka 'const unsigned long *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter has spanified `buffer`, which is a `std::string`. However, the rewriter did not remove the `reinterpret_cast` that was applied to `buffer` before spanification. A reinterpret_cast from `std::string` to `const uint64_t*` is invalid.

## Solution
The rewriter should remove the `reinterpret_cast` entirely. It's no longer needed after spanification and is invalid with `std::string` and `base::span`. The compiler will complain if the conversion is not valid, and then a correct cast (if any) can be applied.
