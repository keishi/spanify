# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_16_patch_919

## First error

../../media/base/audio_buffer.cc:360:16: error: no matching constructor for initialization of 'media::AudioBuffer'
  360 |   return base::MakeRefCounted<AudioBuffer>(
      |                ^
../../media/base/audio_buffer.cc:123:14: note: candidate constructor not viable: no known conversion from 'base::span<const unsigned char *const>' to 'const uint8_t *const *' (aka 'const unsigned char *const *') for 8th argument

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `AudioBuffer::CopyBitstreamFrom` was modified to take a `base::span<const uint8_t* const> data` argument, however the call site `media/mojo/common/media_type_converters.cc` passes `&data` which has type `uint8_t**`. There is no implicit conversion from `uint8_t**` to `base::span<const uint8_t* const>`. The rewriter spanified `AudioBuffer::CopyBitstreamFrom` but failed to spanify its call site.

## Solution
The rewriter should also transform the call site to pass the span correctly. Change `&data` to `base::span<uint8_t*>(&data, 1)` where the size `1` is because there is just a single pointer. The correct code should be like this:

```c++
 return media::AudioBuffer::CopyBitstreamFrom(
        input->sample_format, input->channel_layout, input->channel_count,
        input->sample_rate, input->frame_count, base::span<uint8_t*>(&data, 1),
        input->data.size(), input->timestamp);
```

## Note
There were additional errors reported.
```
../../media/base/audio_buffer.cc:123:14: note: candidate constructor not viable: requires 8 arguments, but 11 were provided
  123 | AudioBuffer::AudioBuffer(base::PassKey<AudioBuffer>,

../../media/base/audio_buffer.cc:232:14: note: candidate constructor not viable: requires 8 arguments, but 11 were provided
  232 | AudioBuffer::AudioBuffer(base::PassKey<AudioBuffer>,
```
These stem from the same error in `media/base/audio_buffer.cc` and the same fix will address these issues as well.
