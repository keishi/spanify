# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1912

## First error

../../media/filters/wsola_internals.cc:440:10: error: no matching function for call to 'FullSearch'
  440 |   return FullSearch(lim_low, lim_high, exclude_interval, target_block,

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The function `FullSearch` was spanified, but the call site at `media/filters/wsola_internals.cc:440` is still passing a raw pointer for the `energy_candidate_blocks` argument. The compiler cannot implicitly convert a raw pointer to `base::span` without size information. The rewriter should have recognized this and either rewritten the call site to construct a span or avoided spanifying the function in the first place. This seems to be a bug with the rewriter where it failed to recognize a size info unavailable rhs value.

## Solution
The rewriter should identify call sites that pass raw pointers to spanified functions and either:
1.  Rewrite the call site to construct a `base::span` from the raw pointer and its size, if the size is known.
2.  If the size is not known or cannot be easily determined, revert the spanification of the function to avoid breaking the build.

## Note
The rewriter changed the function signature in `media/filters/wsola_internals.h` but failed to update the corresponding call site, resulting in the error. This is the root cause of the issue.
