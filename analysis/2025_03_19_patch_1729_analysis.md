## First error

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the ReadData function. However, the call site is using `buffer + bytes_read` which is not a valid operation on span. The rewriter should have transformed this expression to use subspan.

## Solution
The rewriter should apply a subspan transform when a span parameter is used in pointer arithmetic, similar to how it applies a .data() transform when passing a span to a function that takes a raw pointer.

## Note
There are other errors after this one. The rewriter also used reinterpret_cast on `base::span<uint32_t, 1>` to `uint8_t*`, which is wrong.
