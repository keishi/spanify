## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/tests/gl_copy_texture_CHROMIUM_unittest.cc:334:20: error: incompatible operand types ('uint8_t[4]' (aka 'unsigned char[4]') and 'std::array<uint8_t, 4>' (aka 'array<unsigned char, 4>'))
  334 |               (alt ? alt_expected_color : expected_color)[j];
      |                    ^ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The code uses a ternary operator to select between two `uint8_t[4]` arrays.  The rewriter then converted one of those `uint8_t[4]` arrays into `std::array<uint8_t, 4>`, but didn't convert the other one. Because of this the compiler is complaining about using a ternary operator with two incompatible types.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to apply the changes to both arrays. Or avoid using the ternary operator.

## Note
The other errors are likely follow-on errors from this original error.
