# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1220

## First error

../../components/sessions/core/session_command.h:54:40: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'char *' to function return type 'base::span<char>'

## Category
Rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The `contents()` method in `SessionCommand` was intended to return a `base::span<char>`, but the original code returned `char*`. The rewriter has correctly spanified the return type in the header, but failed to update the return statement to adapt to the changed return type. It is trying to implicitly convert a `char*` to a `base::span<char>`. The return statement needs to explicitly construct a `base::span<char>` from the pointer.

## Solution
The `contents()` method needs to be updated to correctly return a `base::span<char>` constructed from the raw pointer.

```c++
base::span<char> contents() { return base::span(const_cast<char*>(contents_.c_str()), contents_.size()); }
```

The corrected method explicitly constructs a `base::span<char>` from the character data of `contents_` and its size. `base::span` will then manage the lifetime and bounds of the data safely.

## Note
The error only appears to be in the header file.
