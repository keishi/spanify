# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_494

## First error

../../chrome/browser/themes/browser_theme_pack.h:359:24: error: no viable conversion from 'std::nullptr_t' to 'base::raw_span<SourceImage, DanglingUntriaged | AllowPtrArithmetic>' (aka 'span<SourceImage, dynamic_extent, raw_ptr<SourceImage, (RawPtrTraits)9U | AllowPtrArithmetic>>')
  359 |       source_images_ = nullptr;
      |                        ^~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to nullptr initialization of spanified member field to {}.

## Reason
The rewriter changed the type of `source_images_` to `base::raw_span<SourceImage, DanglingUntriaged | AllowPtrArithmetic>`, but it did not update the initialization to use `{}` instead of `nullptr`. `base::span` does not have an implicit conversion from `nullptr`.

## Solution
The rewriter should replace `nullptr` with `{}` when initializing spanified member fields.

For example:

```diff
--- a/chrome/browser/themes/browser_theme_pack.h
+++ b/chrome/browser/themes/browser_theme_pack.h
-  raw_ptr<SourceImage, DanglingUntriaged | AllowPtrArithmetic> source_images_ =
-      nullptr;
+  base::raw_span<SourceImage, DanglingUntriaged | AllowPtrArithmetic>
+      source_images_ = {};

```

## Note
The patch also contains other errors that would need to be addressed:

1.  It appears the patch tries to dereference the `pointer` variable, which now represents `base::span<char>`, and not `char*`. Dereferencing is done using unary `*` operator. The correct code should be like this:
`reinterpret_cast<SourceImage*>(const_cast<char*>(pointer->data()));`.

2.  In the `WriteToDisk` function, the type of `end` is `base::span<SourceImage>`, not `SourceImage*`. Therefore the `.id` member access would not work. Also `source_images_[0]` should be used.

3.  In the `HasCustomImage` function, the type of `img` is `base::span<SourceImage>`, not `SourceImage*`. Therefore the `.id` member access would not work. Also `source_images_[0]` should be used.
