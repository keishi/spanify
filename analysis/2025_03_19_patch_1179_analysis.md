## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `base::span`'s `subspan()` method takes a `size_t` as an argument. The code calculates the offset as `(yy * kResolution + xx) * 4`, which is an `int`. When passing this `int` to `subspan()`, a `strict_cast` is performed to convert it to `size_t`. However, the `strict_cast` function in `base/numerics/safe_conversions.h` doesn't have a matching overload for `int` to `size_t` because it determines that the range of `int` is not always contained within the range of `size_t`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate a `static_cast<size_t>` when rewriting the `subspan` call.

## Note
There are also errors that occur because `base::span` was used in pointer arithmetic:
```
../../gpu/command_buffer/tests/gl_depth_texture_unittest.cc:211:38: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>') and 'int')
  211 |         const uint8_t* left = actual - 4;
      |                               ~~~~~~ ^ ~
../../gpu/command_buffer/tests/gl_depth_texture_unittest.cc:212:38: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>') and 'int')
  212 |         const uint8_t* down = actual - kResolution * 4;
```
This is not the first error so will not be classified here.
