# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_464

## First error
../../components/os_crypt/sync/kwallet_dbus_unittest.cc:195:38: error: cannot initialize a parameter of type 'const uint8_t **' (aka 'const unsigned char **') with an rvalue of type 'base::span<const uint8_t> *' (aka 'span<const unsigned char> *')

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
`DBusMethodCallReader::PopArrayOfBytes` expects a raw pointer `const uint8_t** bytes`. The rewriter replaced the raw pointer with `base::span<const uint8_t> bytes = {}`, so the type passed to `PopArrayOfBytes` is now `base::span<const uint8_t>*` instead of `const uint8_t**`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to detect this case where a function expects `Type**` but it is receiving `base::span<Type>*`. If this is the case, then the rewriter should pass `&bytes.data()` and rewrite the subsequent code to access the bytes through `bytes`. This case is actually equivalent to having a raw pointer, except with base::span the size is also available.

## Note
The diff also has another minor error in the following line:

```
-  vec.assign(bytes, bytes + length);
+  vec.assign(bytes.data(), bytes.subspan(length).data());
```

It looks like this is an attempt to account for the base::span. However, it did not account for the different arguments that assign requires. assign requires a begin iterator and end iterator. A correct transformation would look like this:

```
-  vec.assign(bytes, bytes + length);
+  vec.assign(bytes.data(), bytes.data() + length);
