# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1390

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan()` method requires an unsigned integer as argument. However, the code passes a signed integer value to it.

```c++
base::span<ContentAnalysisResponse>(responses).subspan(i).data()
```

The variable `i` is a `size_t` type, but the rewriter isn't correctly generating the cast to `size_t` which implicitly converts the value to `unsigned long`.

## Solution
The rewriter should explicitly cast `i` to `size_t` before calling `subspan()`.

```c++
base::span<ContentAnalysisResponse>(responses).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(i)).data()
```

## Note
This error appears multiple times in the build log.
