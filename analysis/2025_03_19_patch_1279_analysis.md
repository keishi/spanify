# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1279

## First error

../../ui/events/ozone/evdev/tablet_event_converter_evdev.cc:94:22: error: member reference base type 'input_event[4]' is not a structure or union
   94 |       read(fd, inputs.data(),
      |                ~~~~~~^~~~~

## Category
Rewriter encountered a case where it failed to add .data() when converting a C-style array to std::array in a third_party function call.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to use `.data()` on a C-style array that was not converted to a `std::array`. When `inputs` is changed to `base::span<const input_event> inputs`, the code inside the function becomes incorrect. `inputs` inside the function `TabletEventConverterEvdev::OnFileCanReadWithoutBlocking` is a raw array, not a class object. The compiler is correct that `inputs.data()` is invalid since `inputs` is a raw array. The rewriter should add `.data()` when that variable is passed to a third_party function call, but it did not.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to recognize the `read` function and add `.data()` to the `inputs` variable when it converts to `base::span`.

## Note
There were additional errors related to this same issue:
