# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_567

## First error

../../chrome/browser/shell_integration_linux.cc:787:21: error: no viable conversion from 'gchar *' (aka 'char *') to 'base::span<gchar>' (aka 'span<char>')
  787 |   base::span<gchar> data_dump = g_key_file_to_data(key_file, &length, NULL);

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The function `g_key_file_to_data` is a GLib function (third_party) that returns a `gchar*`. The rewriter is attempting to assign this raw pointer directly to a `base::span<gchar>`. This requires constructing a span from the raw pointer, but the size is not directly available at the call site.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to wrap the third-party function call with code that constructs a `base::span` from the returned pointer and the associated length. The length was passed to the `g_key_file_to_data` function by reference.

## Note
The second error is:

```
../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
../../chrome/browser/shell_integration_linux.cc:794:43: note: in instantiation of function template specialization 'base::internal::StrictNumeric<unsigned long>::StrictNumeric<int>' requested here
  794 |       output_buffer += (data_dump.subspan(1).data());
```

This is a secondary error due to `data_dump` failing to build, as it is not of a span type and lacks the `subspan` method. The first failure is root cause.
