# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1382

## First error

../../net/filter/filter_source_stream_test_util.cc:57:31: error: expected expression
  57 |     dest = dest.subspan(sizeof)(gzip_header);
      |                               ^

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The rewriter incorrectly generated code that attempts to call `subspan` with the result of the expression `sizeof`, likely intending to specify the size of the subspan. The syntax `dest.subspan(sizeof)(gzip_header)` is invalid C++.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to avoid generating code that conflicts with `subspan` by ensuring that parameters to subspan use the correct syntax.

## Note
The second error is:
```
../../net/filter/filter_source_stream_test_util.cc:63:26: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<char>' to 'Cr_z_Bytef *' (aka 'unsigned char *') is not allowed
   63 |   zlib_stream.next_out = reinterpret_cast<Bytef*>(dest);
      |                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```
which is of category Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.
