# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1073

## First error

../../content/web_test/renderer/test_plugin.cc:192:58: error: member reference base type 'uint8_t[3]' (aka 'unsigned char[3]') is not a structure or union
  192 |       ParseColor(attribute_value, scene_.background_color.data());
      |                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The rewriter added `.data()` to `scene_.background_color` which is a `uint8_t[3]`. While `scene_.background_color` looks like it should have been arrayified, the code snippet in the diff reveals that the rewriter failed to arrayify it. The `.data()` call is invalid on a C-style array.

## Solution
The rewriter should not add `.data()` to `scene_.background_color` if it didn't arrayify or spanify it.

## Note
The second error is similar:
```
../../content/web_test/renderer/test_plugin.cc:194:57: error: member reference base type 'uint8_t[3]' (aka 'unsigned char[3]') is not a structure or union
  194 |       ParseColor(attribute_value, scene_.primitive_color.data());
