## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/common/gles2_cmd_utils.cc:1554:69: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<const EnumToString>' and 'const EnumToString *')

## Category
Rewriter needs to use .data() to access raw pointer in iterator loops for spanified code.

## Reason
The rewriter converted the raw pointer `table` to `base::span<const EnumToString> table`. In the original code, the end pointer is calculated as `table + count`. However `table` is now a span and not a pointer.
`table + count` is no longer a valid operation since `table` is a span.

## Solution
The correct way to calculate the end pointer from a span is `table.subspan(count).data()`, as was used in the original code.
The rewriter should generate equivalent code `table.subspan(count).data()` when a spanified variable is used in pointer arithmetic.

There are 5 additional errors in the compilation log related to this first error.
