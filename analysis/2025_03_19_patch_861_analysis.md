# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_861

## First error

../../build/linux/debian_bullseye_amd64-sysroot/usr/include/string.h:28:1: error: expected member name or ';' after declaration specifiers

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter is adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_autogen.h`. But this header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition (specifically `gpu::gles2::GLES2Interface`).

## Solution
The rewriter needs to avoid including `base/containers/span.h` inside a C++ class declaration. This can be achieved by moving the `#include` statement outside the class declaration or by using forward declarations instead of including the entire header file. A more robust solution would involve analyzing where includes are being placed and preventing includes that transitively include C headers from being placed within `extern "C"` contexts.

## Note
This error also triggered a redefinition of `size_t` due to the unguarded system header `__stddef_size_t.h` being included multiple times.  Fixing the primary issue will likely resolve this secondary error. The missing '}' is a result of the failure to parse the header correctly, due to the initial errors.
