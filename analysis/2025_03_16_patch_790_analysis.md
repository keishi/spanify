# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_16_patch_790

## First error

../../components/zucchini/disassembler_dex.cc:268:17: error: no matching function for call to 'begin'
  268 |       std::fill(std::begin(instruction_table.data()),
      |                 ^~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified instruction_table but then the indexes used in `.subspan()` are signed ints. The index type should be unsigned. The error occurs because the std::fill function requires iterators as arguments, but `instruction_table.data()` returns a pointer, which does not have `begin()` and `end()` methods defined for it. While `std::begin` and `std::end` overloads exist for C-style arrays, they are not applicable to pointers. The larger issue is that the rewriter did not account for the indexes that are being used with subspan.

## Solution
Cast `instr.opcode` and `instr.opcode + instr.variant` to size_t or unsigned before passing them as arguments to `subspan`.

## Note
The other errors in the build log are follow-on errors from the first one.
