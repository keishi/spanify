# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_162

## First error

../../ui/gfx/skbitmap_operations_unittest.cc:55:29: error: no viable conversion from 'unsigned char *' to 'base::span<unsigned char>'
   55 |   base::span<unsigned char> src_data =
      |                             ^
   56 |       reinterpret_cast<unsigned char*>(bmp->getAddr32(0, 0));

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The code is trying to assign a raw pointer returned from a third_party function (`bmp->getAddr32(0, 0)`) to a span. The rewriter is not constructing a span from the raw pointer. This is failing the build because the compiler cannot convert the raw pointer returned by the third_party API call to `base::span<unsigned char>`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate code to explicitly construct a span from the raw pointer, including the size calculation if available. The `SkBitmap::getAddr32` function does not return the size, so the size cannot be determined. This cannot be automatically fixed.

## Note
The rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function (e.g. `SkBitmap::getAddr32`, `webrtc::DesktopFrame::GetFrameDataAtPos`). The size of the return value of this third party function is hard to identify.
