# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_689

## First error

../../components/headless/screen_info/headless_screen_info.cc:83:45: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
   83 |       return kInvalidScreenColorDepth.data().subspan(std)::string(value);
      |              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter failed to recognize function called with .subspan() on `std::array`.

## Reason
The rewriter replaced a `std::string` concatenation with a `.subspan()` call, but did not correctly transform the code. The original code was trying to concatenate `kInvalidScreenColorDepth` with a `std::string(value)` which is valid. But the spanified code is attempting to call a method called `subspan` on `kInvalidScreenColorDepth.data()`, where the type of `kInvalidScreenColorDepth` is `std::array`.  This is invalid C++ code. The rewriter needs to generate C++ that constructs a `std::string` from the `subspan`.

## Solution
The rewriter should insert code to properly call `std::string` with a subspan. The current `std::string` constructor can accept the base as well as the `size` and can construct the string correctly.

```c++
return std::string(kInvalidScreenColorDepth.data(), kInvalidScreenColorDepth.size()) + std::string(value);
```

But now we want to generate the `subspan` object, so

```c++
return std::string(kInvalidScreenColorDepth.data(), kInvalidScreenColorDepth.size()).subspan() + std::string(value);
```

But the rewriter can't generate this today. It can only handle `.data()` and `.size()`.

## Note
The second and third errors are follow-on errors from the first error, they should be ignored.
