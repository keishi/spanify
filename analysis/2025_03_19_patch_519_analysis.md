# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_519

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code is passing an `int` as an argument to `client_ids.subspan(n).data()`, but `subspan` seems to be expecting an unsigned value for its arguments.  The `strict_cast` in `safe_conversions.h` is failing because the constraint `kStaticDstRangeRelationToSrcRange<unsigned long, int> == NumericRangeRepresentation::kContained` is not satisfied.

## Solution
Cast the argument `n` to `subspan` to an unsigned value, like `static_cast<size_t>(n)`.

## Note
None
