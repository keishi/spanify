## First error

../../content/browser/byte_stream_unittest.cc:70:22: error: no viable conversion from 'net::IOBuffer' to 'base::span<char>'

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to convert `*buffer`, which is a `net::IOBuffer`, directly to a `base::span<char>`. However, `net::IOBuffer` doesn't have an implicit conversion operator to `base::span<char>`. The proper way to access the underlying data buffer is to call `buffer->data()` first. The error "no viable conversion" indicates that there isn't a standard conversion between the two types.

## Solution
Change the rewrite rule to generate `buffer->data()` instead of `*buffer`.

```c++
-   base::span<char> bufferp = *buffer;
+   base::span<char> bufferp = base::span(buffer->data(), buffer_size);
```

## Note
The second error also stems from failing to use `.data()` to access the underlying buffer. This will be fixed automatically by the above code change.
