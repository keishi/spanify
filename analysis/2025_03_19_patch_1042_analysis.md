# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1042

## First error

../../ui/gfx/skbitmap_operations.cc:85:26: error: no viable conversion from 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<uint32_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned int>')
   85 |     base::span<uint32_t> second_row = second.getAddr32(0, y);
      |                          ^            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The error indicates that the rewriter is attempting to assign a raw pointer (`uint32_t*`) returned from `second.getAddr32(0, y)` to a `base::span<uint32_t>`. Since `getAddr32` is a third-party function, the rewriter should have generated code to construct a span from the raw pointer, but it did not.  The code likely needs to create a span from the return value, but the size is hard to identify.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to wrap the third-party function call with a span constructor, likely using a placeholder for the size if the size cannot be inferred.

Example:
```c++
base::span<uint32_t> second_row = base::span(second.getAddr32(0, y), <#size#>);
```

## Note
The function `SkBitmap::getAddr32()` is third_party code.
