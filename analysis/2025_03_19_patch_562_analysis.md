# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_562

## First error

../../media/gpu/vaapi/test/h264_decoder.cc:502:24: error: use of undeclared identifier 'ref_pic_marking'

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The rewriter modified the line `sizeof(slice_hdr->ref_pic_marking)` to `(ref_pic_marking.size() * sizeof(decltype(ref_pic_marking)::value_type))`. However, `ref_pic_marking` is not declared in `H264Decoder::InitCurrPicture` function in `media/gpu/vaapi/test/h264_decoder.cc`, so it couldn't be arrayified. This is a bug in the rewriter. The rewriter should only modify code that was affected by spanification.

## Solution
The rewriter should not add code that didn't already exist before. It should not add `.data()` calls to unrelated code.

## Note
The first error occurs because the rewriter attempted to rewrite the code incorrectly by referencing a variable that doesn't exist. The second error stems from the same root cause, with the rewriter making an incorrect modification.
