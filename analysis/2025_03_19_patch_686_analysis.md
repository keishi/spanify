# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_686

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/core/css/properties/css_bitset_test.cc:55:46: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<const size_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned long>') and 'const size_t *' (aka 'const unsigned long *'))

## Category
Pointer to arrayified variable is not correctly handled in comparisons.

## Reason
The `AssertBitset` function signature is changed to take `base::span<const size_t> begin`.
```c++
template <size_t kBits>
void AssertBitset(base::span<const size_t> begin, const size_t* end) {
```
And the original for loop condition was `b != end` which is comparing a `base::span` to a raw pointer. `base::span` does not support comparison to raw pointers.

## Solution
Change the loop from a range based for loop which should not need the end iterator:
```c++
-  for (base::span<const size_t> b = begin; b != end; b++) {
+  for (const size_t& b : begin) {
```

## Note
The other errors are caused by the same thing so the same fix applies. Also, the rewriter should have detected these usages and flagged these automatically.
