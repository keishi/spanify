# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1285

## First error

third_party/blink/renderer/core/layout/block_break_token.h:268:40: error: expected expression
  268 |   std::array<Member<const BreakToken>, > child_break_tokens_;
      |                                        ^

## Category
Rewriter cannot get the size of forward declared array variable.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to use `std::array` with a size that it cannot deduce. In this particular case, the size of the array, is not provided in the `std::array` definition. It can't be deduced because it is a forward declared array variable.

## Solution
The rewriter should not attempt to convert a flexible array member to `std::array`, as the size of the array is unknown at compile time. The conversion to `std::array` is not possible in this case and creates a compile error. It should leave the original flexible array.

## Note
The second error in the build log is a consequence of the first. The rewriter's attempt to convert the flexible array member to std::array failed, leading to a ripple effect throughout the code where the rewriter expected the types to match after the faulty conversion. The initial error is enough to classify this bug.
