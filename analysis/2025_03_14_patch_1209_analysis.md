## First error

../../chrome/browser/themes/browser_theme_pack.h:359:24: error: no viable conversion from 'std::nullptr_t' to 'base::raw_span<SourceImage, DanglingUntriaged | AllowPtrArithmetic>' (aka 'span<SourceImage, dynamic_extent, raw_ptr<SourceImage, (RawPtrTraits)9U | AllowPtrArithmetic>>')
  359 |       source_images_ = nullptr;
      |                        ^~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to nullptr initialization of spanified member field to {}.

## Reason
The rewriter changed `source_images_` from a raw pointer to a `base::raw_span`, but it didn't update the initialization of the field. When `source_images_` was a raw pointer, it was valid to initialize it with `nullptr`. However, `base::span` does not have an implicit conversion from `nullptr_t`. The correct way to initialize a `base::span` to an empty state is to use `{}`.

## Solution
The rewriter should change the initialization from `nullptr` to `{}`. The tool should replace `source_images_ = nullptr;` with `source_images_ = {};`

## Note
The clang error message explains that there isn't a valid conversion from `std::nullptr_t` to `base::raw_span<SourceImage, DanglingUntriaged | AllowPtrArithmetic>`. This confirms that this is a initialization problem and also highlights the target type.
