## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `struct input_event* queue` to `base::span<struct input_event> queue`. The code `queue + queue_index` attempts to add a `long` to the `span`, which is not allowed. Instead the user should call `queue.subspan(queue_index)`. The rewriter didn't account for this. It should have rewritten `queue + queue_index` to `queue.subspan(queue_index)`. It needs to apply `subspan` to the expression `queue + queue_index` due to its use of pointer arithmetic.

## Solution
The rewriter should be updated to rewrite pointer arithmetic on `base::span` types by calling `subspan`. This should be applied when the span variable is used as the left hand side of an addition expression, and the right hand side is an index. The rewriter should also handle the cases with reverse operator order and operators like `-`. For the particular case of this error, the tool can rewrite `queue + queue_index` to `queue.subspan(queue_index)`. Note however that this particular code is part of HANDLE_EINTR macro. So the solution is to rewrite the macro in question, to remove the `+` operator.

## Note
There's a related error where `NULL` is being passed into a `base::span` parameter. The rewriter also needs to flag this case as a failure because the `ConfigureReadMock` function now takes a `base::span` which is not nullable.
