# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_976

## First error

../../content/browser/media/capture/desktop_capture_device.cc:623:40: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<uint8_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned char>') and 'const int')

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter transformed `temp_buffer_y` into a `base::span<uint8_t>`. However, it failed to update the subsequent pointer arithmetic operation `temp_buffer_y + temp_plane_size_y`. Because `temp_buffer_y` is now a span, `+` is no longer a valid operator. The intended behavior is to perform pointer arithmetic on the underlying data pointer of the span, which requires accessing it with `.data()`.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize that `temp_buffer_y` has been transformed into a `base::span<uint8_t>` and automatically add `.data()` when it encounters pointer arithmetic operations.

## Note
The same error exists on line 681.
