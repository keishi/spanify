## First error

../../device/bluetooth/dbus/fake_bluetooth_gatt_characteristic_client.cc:623:11: error: declaration of anonymous struct must be a definition

## Category
Rewriter generated invalid code for constructing a span from an anonymous struct.

## Reason
The code emitted by the rewriter is invalid C++. The rewriter attempted to specify the anonymous struct inline within the `base::span` instantiation, which is not allowed. Anonymous structures must be defined elsewhere.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid trying to create `base::span` types that use unnamed inline types. This is not valid C++. If necessary, the code rewriter should create a named struct and use that in the span.

## Note
The other errors are a consequence of this first error. Once this is addressed they should go away.
