# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_466

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/core/dom/element_data_cache.cc:44:63: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('std::array<Attribute, 0>' and 'unsigned int')
   44 |                     UNSAFE_TODO(element_data.attribute_array_ +

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The code attempts to add an integer offset to `element_data.attribute_array_`, which is now a `std::array`. This is incorrect because `std::array` does not support pointer arithmetic directly.  The `UNSAFE_TODO` around it likely indicates that it's auto-generated and needs to be updated post-spanification, but the rewriter failed to do so. Since `.data()` was added to `attribute_array_` to create the span, any pointer arithmetic needs to be applied to `.data()`, not `attribute_array_` itself.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to correctly update the expression to use `.data()` when pointer arithmetic is performed on a spanified member `std::array`. If the rewriter creates `base::span(attribute_array_.data(), ...)` it also needs to rewrite later uses of `attribute_array_ + offset` to `attribute_array_.data() + offset`.

## Note
The same error also occurs on line 44, but let's focus on addressing the first error.
