## First error
```
../../gpu/command_buffer/service/program_manager_unittest.cc:539:9: error: use of undeclared identifier 'kUniform1Name'; did you mean 'ProgramManagerWithShaderTest::kUniform1Name'?
  539 |         kUniform1Name,
      |         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
      |         ProgramManagerWithShaderTest::kUniform1Name
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to use fully qualified name inside std::to_array.

## Reason
The rewriter transformed a C-style array to `std::to_array`. But the code inside the initializer list is using a name that is only valid within the class, but not valid inside the `std::to_array` call. The rewriter should have transformed the unqualified name to the qualified name.

## Solution
The AST matcher that finds the location to replace should also check if the code is inside `std::to_array`. If so, it should transform the unqualified name to the qualified name.

## Note
All the errors stem from the same root cause.
