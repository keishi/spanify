# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1656

## First error

../../ui/events/devices/x11/device_data_manager_x11.cc:402:11: error: cannot increment value of type 'base::span<const x11::Input::Fp3232>'
  402 |           ++valuators;
      |           ^ ~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The code is trying to increment a `base::span<const x11::Input::Fp3232>` variable using `++valuators;`. However, span itself cannot be incremented like a pointer. The original code used pointer arithmetic on a raw pointer, and the rewriter failed to replace this with span operations.

## Solution
The rewriter should use span::subspan() or explicitly calculate the offset and index into the array using operator[]. For example, replace `++valuators` with `valuators = valuators.subspan(1);`. But because valuators is const, it should assign to a new variable instead.

## Note
The error message clearly indicates that the span is being incremented which is not a valid operation. The original code used a pointer and now we have a span.
