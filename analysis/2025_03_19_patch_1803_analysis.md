# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1803

## First error

../../chrome/browser/ui/webui/settings/site_settings_handler.cc:598:7: error: no matching function for call to 'StartsWith'

## Category
Rewriter needs to add .data() to arrayified `char[]` variable used with std::string.

## Reason
The code uses `base::StartsWith` which takes two `std::string_view` as arguments. The second argument was an arrayified variable `kGroupingKeyEtldPrefix` of type `std::array<char, 6>`, but it was passed directly to the function call without `.data()`. This caused a type mismatch. The rewriter needs to add `.data()` to the arrayified variable when used with `std::string`.

## Solution
The rewriter should add `.data()` to the arrayified variable when used with `std::string` to convert it to `char*` which can implicitly convert to `std::string_view`.

## Note
No other errors were found in the build log.
