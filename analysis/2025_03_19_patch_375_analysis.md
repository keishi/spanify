# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_375

## First error

../../components/policy/core/common/generate_policy_source_unittest.cc:128:37: error: cannot increment value of type 'base::span<const char *>'
  128 |        !it.IsAtEnd(); it.Advance(), ++next) {
      |                                     ^ ~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter replaced `const char** next = kExpectedProperties;` with `base::span<const char*> next = kExpectedProperties;`, but then failed to update `++next` to the correct code. Span is not a pointer, so it cannot be incremented with `++`.

## Solution
When the rewriter spanifies variables, it should update the increment operations to be compatible with spans. In this case it should increment the pointer inside the span. This can be accomplished by creating a new variable to track the current index.

Original code:
```c++
const char** next = kExpectedProperties;
        !it.IsAtEnd(); it.Advance(), ++next
```

New code:
```c++
size_t next_index = 0;
base::span<const char*> next = kExpectedProperties;
        !it.IsAtEnd(); it.Advance(), next_index++
```

## Note
Additional errors are no matching operator exception and indirection requires pointer operand. These errors are all caused by the same failure to recognize span usages as not being pointer.
