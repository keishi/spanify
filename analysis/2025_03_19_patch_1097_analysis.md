# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1097

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/core/imagebitmap/image_bitmap_test.cc:383:30: error: no viable conversion from 'const uint32_t *' (aka 'const unsigned int *') to 'base::span<const uint32_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned int>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The rewriter is trying to assign the return value of `pixmap.addr32()` to a `base::span<const uint32_t>`. However, `pixmap.addr32()` returns a raw pointer `const uint32_t*`. The rewriter needs to generate code to explicitly construct a `base::span` from the raw pointer. The size information is missing.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate code to construct a `base::span` from the raw pointer returned by `pixmap.addr32()`. Since the size is unknown and `pixmap` is from third_party, the tool should stop spanifying it.

## Note
The function `SkPixmap::addr32()` is from third_party code.
