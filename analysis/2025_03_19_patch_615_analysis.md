## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webaudio/periodic_wave.cc:312:41: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from '__m128i *' to 'base::span<__m128i, 1>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The code attempts to create a `base::span` from the address of a local variable `v_index2` which has type `__m128i`. Then this span is used in `reinterpret_cast`, which is not allowed by the rewriter. 

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid introducing `reinterpret_cast` calls when spanifying code. If such casts already exist, rewriter needs to properly convert code to make it valid after the span introduction. In this specific case, the code should likely avoid creating span in the first place.
