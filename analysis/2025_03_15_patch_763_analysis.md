## First error

../../chrome/browser/autocomplete/search_provider_unittest.cc:2410:11: error: cannot initialize object of type 'std::array<char, 1024>' with an expression of type 'const char [1024]'

## Category
Rewriter needs to use braces around initialization of subobject in array initialization.

## Reason
The code attempts to initialize a `struct` containing a `std::array` as a member, within an array of such structs, without using braces around the initialization of the `std::array` member.
This initialization style is deprecated and the compiler now requires explicit braces to resolve ambiguity. This issue arises because the rewriter changed a C-style array to `std::array` and the initialization style used previously is no longer valid.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to add an extra set of braces around the initialization of any `std::array` elements within an aggregate initializer list.

```cpp
// old:
{ "a.com",   AutocompleteMatchType::SEARCH_WHAT_YOU_TYPED, true },

// new:
{ { "a.com",   AutocompleteMatchType::SEARCH_WHAT_YOU_TYPED, true } },
```

## Note
The rewriter caused "excess elements in struct initializer" errors because it failed to add the required braces when converting from C-style array to std::array within the struct's initialization.
