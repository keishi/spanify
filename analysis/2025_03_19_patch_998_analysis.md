# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_998

## First error

../../media/gpu/vaapi/vaapi_jpeg_decoder.cc:56:22: error: use of undeclared identifier 'value'

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `uint8_t value[kDctSize]` to `std::array<uint8_t, kDctSize> value`. Then, the code tried to take the size of `value` as if it were a `base::span`, using `value.size()`. However this should be a `q_table[0].value.size()` since `q_table` still contains a C-style array. Rewriter needs to be able to apply `q_table[0].value.size()` on C-style arrays within structures too.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to handle spanifying `value` within structure but fails to apply to `q_table` field. The rewriter logic needs to handle this edge case for nested structure access correctly.

## Note
None
