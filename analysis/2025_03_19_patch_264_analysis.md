# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_264

## First error

../../components/image_fetcher/core/image_fetcher_metrics_reporter.cc:160:3: error: no matching function for call to 'UmaHistogramSparse'

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `kNetworkRequestStatusCodes` to a `std::array`, but failed to update the first call to `UmaHistogramSparse` to use `.data()`. The `UmaHistogramSparse` function requires a `const std::string&`, `const char*`, or `std::string_view` as its first argument, but the code is passing a `std::array<char, 31>`. The second call to `UmaHistogramSparse` was correctly updated to call `.data()` on the array. The rewriter missed updating the first call.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to also add `.data()` to the first call to `UmaHistogramSparse`, converting it into a C-style string.

## Note
The rewriter should apply the fix consistently to all call sites of the function.
