## First error

../../testing/libfuzzer/proto/skia_image_filter_proto_converter.cc:204:12: error: unused variable 'kCountNibBits' [-Werror,-Wunused-const-variable]

## Category
Rewriter should not introduce code that violates existing linting rules.

## Reason
The rewriter introduced an unused variable `kCountNibBits` which violates `-Wunused-const-variable` The rewriter converted a C-style array to a `std::array` using `std::to_array`. However, the new variable was not subsequently used, triggering the compiler warning, which was treated as an error due to `-Werror`.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid introducing unused variables. If the original C-style array was unused, the rewriter should not attempt to convert it to a `std::array`. The rewriter could check for usage of the variable after rewrite and only do the rewrite if there is some usage.

## Note
No other errors were observed.
