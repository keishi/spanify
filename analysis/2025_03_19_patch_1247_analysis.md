# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1247

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_implementation_unittest.cc:2199:32: error: member reference base type 'uint8_t[45]' (aka 'unsigned char[45]') is not a structure or union
 2199 |       GetExpectedMemory((pixels.size() * sizeof(decltype(pixels)::value_type)));
      |                          ~~~~~~^~~~~

## Category
Rewriter added .size() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The code `pixels.size()` is causing a compilation error because `pixels` was not converted to `std::array` or `base::span`. The rewriter incorrectly assumed `pixels` had a `.size()` method after the attempted spanification, but the spanification failed, leaving the original C-style array. Because `pixels` is of type `uint8_t[45]`, it does not have the `.size()` method.

## Solution
The rewriter should only add `.size()` to variables/members if they have been correctly spanified or arrayified. This likely indicates a failure to update the AST correctly after the intended rewrite. Review rewriter code to ensure `.size()` is added only after the rewrite has been successful. It should check if the variable is an array, if so, keep `sizeof(array)`, if it is a span then change it to `.size()`.

## Note
Several errors exist in the log:
1.  `pixels.size()` is invalid as `pixels` was not correctly rewritten.
2.  There was a failure to convert from `uint8_t*` to `base::span<const uint8_t>`.
3.  There was a failed `reinterpret_cast` after applying the span rewriter.
4.  The rewriter also failed to update the `CheckRect` function call, indicating that the rewriter may not have correctly updated all call sites to account for the use of `base::span`.
