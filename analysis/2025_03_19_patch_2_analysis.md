## First error

../../chrome/browser/extensions/api/declarative_content/content_action_unittest.cc:306:24: error: no viable conversion from 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<uint32_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned int>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The code calls a third-party function `bitmap.getAddr32(0, 0)` which returns a raw pointer `uint32_t*`. The rewriter then attempts to assign the raw pointer to a `base::span<uint32_t>`. Since `getAddr32` is a third_party function, the rewriter cannot change the function signature to return a `base::span`. Instead, the rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the returned raw pointer. The error message `no viable conversion from 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<uint32_t>'` indicates that the rewriter is not generating the necessary code to create a span from the raw pointer.

## Solution
The rewriter should generate code to explicitly construct a `base::span` from the raw pointer returned by `bitmap.getAddr32(0, 0)`. Since the size of the memory pointed to by the return of getAddr32() is not known in general, it is impossible to generate a correct fix. In this specific case, the size can be deduced because the variable `bitmap` is available. But a general fix is not possible and should be banned.
