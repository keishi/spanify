# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_699

## First error

../../chrome/browser/process_singleton_posix.cc:232:44: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<char>' and 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned long'))
  232 |     ssize_t rv = HANDLE_EINTR(read(fd, buf + bytes_read, bufsize - bytes_read));
      |                                        ~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~~~~
../../base/posix/eintr_wrapper.h:42:14: note: expanded from macro 'HANDLE_EINTR'
   42 |     decltype(x) eintr_wrapper_result;                        \

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified `ReadFromSocket`, but the `read` function is system code, so it is excluded. The rewriter shouldn't spanify functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Solution
The rewriter should not rewrite `ReadFromSocket` to take `base::span<char>` as an argument. This can be accomplished by checking if the arguments of the function that the rewriter is trying to change contains a system call. The logic may already exist as part of the "Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code." category.

## Note
The third error indicates:
```
../../base/check.h:144:14: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('std::ostream' (aka 'basic_ostream<char>') and 'std::array<char, 9>')
  144 |     stream() << streamed_type;
      |     ~~~~~~~~ ^  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
../../chrome/browser/process_singleton_posix.cc:946:66: note: in instantiation of function template specialization 'logging::CheckError::operator<<<std::array<char, 9> &>' requested here
  946 |   NOTREACHED() << "The other process returned unknown message: " << buf;
      |
```

Rewriter should add .data() to arrayified `char[]` variable used with std::ostream.
