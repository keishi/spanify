## First error

../../ui/accessibility/platform/inspect/ax_inspect_utils.cc:29:42: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
   29 |   return kOrderedKeyPrefixDictAttr.data().subspan(
      |          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to add .data() to `char[]` converted to std::array passed to `base::StringPrintf`.

## Reason
The rewriter converted the `char[]` variable `kOrderedKeyPrefixDictAttr` to `std::array`, but it is being used with `.subspan()`. The rewriter should recognize this pattern and add `.data()` before `.subspan()`. The error message says that `.data()` was called on a variable with type `const char*`, which means that the compiler is interpreting `kOrderedKeyPrefixDictAttr` as a pointer, not as an object with a `.data()` method.

## Solution
The rewriter should add `.data()` to `kOrderedKeyPrefixDictAttr` when it's converted to std::array and being used with `.subspan()`.

## Note
This is another instance where the rewriter fails to add .data() to char arrays after converting to std::array.
