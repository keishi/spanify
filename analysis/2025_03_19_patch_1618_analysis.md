# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1618

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/graphics/logging_canvas.cc:574:23: error: member reference base type 'SkScalar[16]' (aka 'float[16]') is not a structure or union

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The code changes add `.data()` to the `m` variable in the lines:

```c++
matrix.getColMajor(m.data());
```

However, the `m` variable is a `SkScalar[16]`, a C-style array, and not a `std::array` or `base::span`. The rewriter incorrectly added the `.data()` call, which is only valid for `std::array` or `base::span` objects. The rewriter is modifying code outside the intended scope of spanification.

## Solution
The rewriter should be fixed to only add `.data()` to variables or members it has actually converted to `std::array` or `base::span`. The rewriter should not be making changes to code it did not intend to spanify. The logic should be updated to verify if `m` is spanified before adding `.data()`.

## Note
The error occurs at two locations in the code.
