## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code is using `kTestData1` in a `subspan` operation, and then passing the result to a `std::string` constructor. The `subspan` function returns a `base::span`, and it appears that the index being passed to `subspan` requires a cast to an unsigned type to be compatible with the `strict_cast` used internally.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to ensure that arguments passed to base::span::subspan() are cast to an unsigned value to avoid the `strict_cast` error.

## Note
Several errors are caused by implicit conversions failing after spanification. The rewriter changes the type of `kTestData1` to `std::string_view`. This type isn't implicitly convertible to `const std::string&` in `BlobDataBuilder::AppendData` or to `const std::string&` in `TestSuccessNonrangeRequest`. To fix it, call `.data()` on kTestData1 to pass a `const char*` to the functions that expect it.
