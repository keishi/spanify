# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_586

## First error
../../net/http/http_cache_transaction.h:204:5: error: [chromium-style] Complex constructor has an inlined body.

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The spanify tool modified `net/http/http_cache_transaction.h` to use `std::array` instead of `std::string[]`. This change required including the `<array>` header file, which transitively includes system headers such as `<string.h>`. Because the tool placed the `#include <array>` directive inside the class definition, the `__BEGIN_DECLS` macro (defined in `<string.h>`) caused a syntax error.

## Solution
The rewriter should place the `#include <array>` directive at the top of the header file, outside of any class definitions. This will prevent the system headers from being included within the scope of a class definition.

## Note
The error message "Complex constructor has an inlined body" is a secondary style error related to the use of a default constructor in the `ValidationHeaders` struct. While this error is present in the build log, it is not the root cause of the build failure and is therefore outside the scope of this analysis.
