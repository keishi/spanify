## First error

../../ui/accessibility/platform/inspect/ax_inspect_utils.cc:29:42: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
   29 |   return kOrderedKeyPrefixDictAttr.data().subspan(
      |          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The rewriter incorrectly added `.data()` to `kOrderedKeyPrefixDictAttr` which is a `std::array`. Because it's already an array, `.data()` is not necessary, and in this case it makes the code invalid because `.data()` returns a raw pointer and `.subspan()` is being called on it as if it were an object.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be more careful about adding `.data()` only to variables that have been converted to `std::array` or `base::span`. The solution here is to avoid adding `.data()` in the first place. The fix is to update the rewriter to not apply `.data()` to `std::array` variables when calling `.subspan()`.

## Note
There is another similar error on line 68.
