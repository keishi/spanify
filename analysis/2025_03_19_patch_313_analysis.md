# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_313

## First error

../../remoting/host/xsession_chooser_linux.cc:259:26: error: expected unqualified-id
  259 |   if (base::span<gchar*> !desktop_names.empty() =
      |                          ^

## Category
Rewriter needs to handle variable redeclaration when applying the span rewrite.

## Reason
The rewriter is adding the span type, but failing to remove the variable initialization. This is invalid C++ syntax.

## Solution
The rewriter should remove the original `gchar** desktop_names = ` from the line.

```c++
-  if (gchar** desktop_names =
+  if (base::span<gchar*> desktop_names !empty() =
```

## Note
There are extra errors about `desktop_names` because it is no longer declared. This will be fixed with the proposed change.
