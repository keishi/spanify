# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1423

## First error

../../chrome/browser/devtools/device/usb/android_usb_browsertest.cc:372:9: error: reinterpret_cast from 'const std::string' (aka 'const basic_string<char>') to 'const uint8_t *' (aka 'const unsigned char *') is not allowed
  372 |         reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(body);
      |         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the `body` variable, but left a `reinterpret_cast` applied to it. Rewriter needs to be able to remove it. The error indicates an attempt to `reinterpret_cast` a `std::string` to `const uint8_t*`, which is disallowed.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be updated to detect the spanified variable `body` and remove the `reinterpret_cast` when spanifying. In this case, using `body.data()` directly would resolve the issue and be a safe operation. Thus the diff should look like:

```diff
-    const auto* body_head = reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(body.data());
+    base::span<const uint8_t> body_head = body;
     std::copy(body_head.data(), body_head.subspan(body.size()).data(),
               std::back_inserter(output_buffer_));
```

## Note
The code also uses `body_head.subspan(body.size()).data()` which is redundant since `body_head` was spanified, so it could be `body_head.size()` which would be correct. However, this error does not prevent compiling so it is not the priority.
