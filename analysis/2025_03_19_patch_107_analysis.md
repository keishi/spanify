## First error

../../base/substring_set_matcher/substring_set_matcher.h:194:21: error: reinterpret_cast from 'const std::array<AhoCorasickEdge, kNumInlineEdges>' to 'uintptr_t' (aka 'unsigned long') is not allowed
  194 |       DCHECK_EQ(0u, reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(edges_.inline_edges) %

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The error occurs because the rewriter spanified `inline_edges` into `std::array<AhoCorasickEdge, kNumInlineEdges> inline_edges;`, but it left a reinterpret_cast that is applied to it, namely:
```c++
reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(edges_.inline_edges)
```
This is no longer allowed by the compiler and generates the error shown above. The rewriter should have removed it.

## Solution
The rewriter should be able to identify and remove the reinterpret_cast that is applied to `inline_edges`. It is not clear why the reinterpret_cast is needed, but after spanifying `inline_edges`, it is not needed, and the type has changed, which causes the compiler to complain.

## Note
There is also a secondary error:

```
../../base/substring_set_matcher/substring_set_matcher.h:196:35: error: incompatible operand types ('const std::array<AhoCorasickEdge, kNumInlineEdges>' and 'AhoCorasickEdge *const')
  196 |       return edges_capacity_ == 0 ? edges_.inline_edges : edges_.edges;
      |                                   ^ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

The ternary operator is now invalid, because the types of the expressions being returned are different. `edges_.inline_edges` is a `std::array`, and `edges_.edges` is a span. The rewriter needs to generate a span in both cases. To solve this, the rewriter should create a span from `edges_.inline_edges` like this:
```c++
base::span(edges_.inline_edges);
