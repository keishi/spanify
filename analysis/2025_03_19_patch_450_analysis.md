## First error

../../media/muxers/webm_muxer.cc:379:50: error: member reference base type 'uint8_t[19]' (aka 'unsigned char[19]') is not a structure or union

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid adding `.data()` to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The rewriter added `.data()` to `opus_header`, which is a stack allocated array and didn't need it. The function parameter type was changed to span, but the call site was not updated correctly.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid adding .data() to parameters that were not changed to spans. It should only change the type.

## Note
None
