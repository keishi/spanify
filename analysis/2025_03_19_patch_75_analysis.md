# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_75

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/tests/gl_ext_blend_func_extended_unittest.cc:59:19: error: no matching function for call to 'Weight'
   59 |   r[0] = src[0] * Weight<RGBs, 0>(dst, src, src1) +
      |                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified a function, but failed to spanify a call site. The `Weight` function is taking a raw pointer (`float src[4]`), but the `BlendEquationFuncAdd` template (which calls `Weight`) was updated to use `base::span<float, 4> src`. The call to Weight at line 59 passes the function a span, but the function signature expects a raw pointer to `float[4]`.

## Solution
The rewriter should either skip spanifying the Weight function (since that function is called in a template function), or update the `Weight` function signature to use base::span. The best fix is to not spanify Weight.

## Note
This failure is happening in an autogenerated function, which suggests we shouldn't be spanifying this call.
