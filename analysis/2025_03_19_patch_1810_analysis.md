# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1810

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webcodecs/audio_data.cc:655:39: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<uint8_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned char>') to 'int16_t *' (aka 'short *') is not allowed
  655 |       base::span<int16_t> dest_data = reinterpret_cast<int16_t*>(dest);
      |                                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter has spanified the `dest` variable, but left a `reinterpret_cast` that is applied to it. The rewriter needs to be able to remove it. The code is trying to create a `base::span<int16_t>` from a `base::span<uint8_t>` using `reinterpret_cast`, which is not allowed.

## Solution
The rewriter should be able to identify when it has spanified a variable and a `reinterpret_cast` is being performed on it. The rewriter needs to remove the `reinterpret_cast`.

## Note
This is an example of the "Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable" category.
