# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_779

## First error

../../media/base/sinc_resampler_perftest.cc:61:5: error: no matching function for call to 'RunConvolveBenchmark'

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `RunConvolveBenchmark` is being called with `SincResampler::Convolve_AVX2` as an argument. `SincResampler::Convolve_AVX2` has been modified to take a `base::span<const float>` as its second argument, while `RunConvolveBenchmark` still expects a `const float*`. The rewriter spanified a function, but failed to spanify a call site.

## Solution
The rewriter should also update the call site in `sinc_resampler_perftest.cc` to pass a `base::span<const float>` to `RunConvolveBenchmark`. This would involve constructing a span from the existing pointer and size information. Alternatively, the function `RunConvolveBenchmark` can be spanified. But based on the style guide, it is prefered to modify the function to accept span.

## Note
The diff shows that `SincResampler::Convolve_AVX2` was correctly modified to accept `base::span`, but the corresponding call in `sinc_resampler_perftest.cc` was not updated. This mismatch in function signatures is the direct cause of the build failure.
