# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1617

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/graphics/logging_canvas.cc:215:45: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('std::array<SkPoint, 4>' and 'unsigned int')

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The code uses `iter.next(points.data())` which returns a raw pointer to an array. The size is specified by `VerbParams verb_params = SegmentParams(verb);` through `verb_params.point_offset`. But the size is not available when constructing the subspan.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be able to rewrite this code to use `subspan`. The correct code should be.
```c++
for (SkPath::Verb verb = iter.next(points.data()); verb != SkPath::kDone_Verb;
       verb = iter.next(points.data())) {
     VerbParams verb_params = SegmentParams(verb);
     auto path_point_item = std::make_unique<JSONObject>();
     path_point_item->SetString("verb", verb_params.name);
-    UNSAFE_TODO(points + verb_params.point_offset)
+   points.subspan(verb_params.point_offset, 1)
```
In this particular case a subspan with size 1 should be used. This will require more complex AST matching.

## Note
The error message indicates that `points + verb_params.point_offset` is an invalid expression. This happened because `points` was converted to `std::array`, so pointer arithmetic is not allowed on `points`. The correct code should be
`points.subspan(verb_params.point_offset, 1)`
