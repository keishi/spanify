# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1029

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:905:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to handle iterator invalidation in range-based for loops.

## Reason
The rewriter replaced the iterators in the range-based for loop with a `base::span`, but this introduced a type mismatch. The loop initialization expects an iterator, but it is getting a `base::span`. This is because `std::begin` returns an iterator, not a `base::span`.

Additionally, range-based for loops are implemented as iterators, so `++it` increments an iterator. A `base::span` is not an iterator, so it cannot be incremented.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to avoid converting the iterator to `base::span` for range-based loops. The rewriter logic should recognize when a variable is used as an iterator in a `for` loop. In this case, it should leave the iterator type alone.

## Note
The second error message is also caused by the same problem:
```

```
