## First error

../../media/muxers/mp4_movie_box_writer.cc:164:30: error: no viable conversion from 'const int *' to 'base::span<const int>'

## Category
Doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to assign the result of `std::begin(kDisplayIdentityMatrix)` which is a `const int *` to a `base::span<const int>`.  There is no implicit conversion available for this case.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to either not convert this to a base::span, or needs to insert the correct method.

## Note
There is a second error `error: cannot increment value of type 'base::span<const int>'`. It is also present on line 165. This also appears to be due to the rewriter not correctly converting the iterator.
