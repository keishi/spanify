# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_13_patch_590

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code uses `dst_plane.subspan(rows * row_bytes)` where `rows * row_bytes` is of type `int`. But the `subspan` function expects an unsigned integer. `strict_cast` is used internally to do the conversion, but `strict_cast` has constraints that aren't being met.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to explicitly cast the `int` value to an unsigned type before passing it to `subspan()`. For example:

```cpp
dst_plane = dst_plane.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(rows * row_bytes));
```

## Note
The second error is `error: extraneous ')' before ';'`. It's caused by the first error.
