## First error

../../device/bluetooth/dbus/fake_bluetooth_gatt_characteristic_client.cc:623:11: error: declaration of anonymous struct must be a definition
  623 |           struct(unnamed struct at / usr / local / google / home / nuskos /
      |           ^

## Category
Rewriter cannot get the size of forward declared array variable.

## Reason
The rewriter is trying to spanify `value` which is a anonymous struct. The rewriter then failed to determine the size of this struct, likely because it does not have a definition.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to properly handle cases where it can't get the size of a forward declared variable. It should back off from spanifying it if the size cannot be determined.

## Note
There are extra errors in the log, but they are likely caused by the first error.
