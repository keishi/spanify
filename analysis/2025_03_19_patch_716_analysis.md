# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_716

## First error

../../base/memory/raw_ptr_exclusion.h:11:10: fatal error: 'partition_alloc/pointers/raw_ptr_exclusion.h' file not found

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter is adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in a header file. But this header transitively includes system headers like `../../base/memory/raw_ptr_exclusion.h` which is not found. The reason this include is happening in the first place is because of the unsafe buffers build.

## Solution
Avoid adding this include if we are in the unsafe buffers build.

## Note
The rewriter spanified `uint16_t* p_src_v_16 = reinterpret_cast<uint16_t*>(malloc(src_uv_plane_size * 2));` to `base::span<uint16_t> p_src_v_16 = reinterpret_cast<uint16_t*>(malloc(src_uv_plane_size * 2));`. This is fine, but it added the include in the wrong place.
