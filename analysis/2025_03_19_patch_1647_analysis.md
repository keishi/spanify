# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1647

## First error

../../content/browser/media/capture/frame_test_util.cc:146:5: error: no matching function for call to 'StimsToN32Row'

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the function `StimsToN32Row` that takes a `base::span<uint8_t>` as an argument, but failed to properly convert the `uint8_t*` pointer being passed into that function at the call site. It seems to be a bug with the rewriter where it failed to recognize a size info unavailable rhs value.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to correctly handle cases where a raw `uint8_t*` pointer is passed to a function that now expects a `base::span<uint8_t>`. The rewriter should add logic to create a span from the pointer and size at the call site, similar to how it handles other conversions to spans. In this case, it seems like the size of the `bgra_out` buffer is not explicitly known at the callsite, the rewriter will need to add an expression for determining the size, which appears to be `bitmap.width()*4`.

## Note
The provided build failure log shows only one error. There may be more errors after this one, but those are not considered in this analysis.
