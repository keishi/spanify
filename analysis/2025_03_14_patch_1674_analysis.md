# Build Failure Analysis: 1195

## First error

../../base/containers/span.h:297:12: error: class template argument deduction failed: no matching function for call to 'base::CheckedContiguousIterator::CheckedContiguousIterator(float *, float *)'

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter added `#include "base/containers/span.h"` to `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_implementation_autogen.h`. This header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition.

## Solution
Don't add include statements inside header files. Specifically, avoid adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_implementation_autogen.h` or any similar autogenerated header files.

## Note
There are other errors related to redefinition of size_t, which are all caused by the same root cause of including system headers inside a C++ class declaration.
