# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_764

## First error

../../build/linux/debian_bullseye_amd64-sysroot/usr/include/string.h:28:1: error: expected member name or ';' after declaration specifiers

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter is adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in a header file. But this header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` inside a header file that would lead to this syntax error.

## Note
There are other errors in the log, including redefinition of `size_t` and other syntax errors. All of these stem from including system headers inside the class declaration.
