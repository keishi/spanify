# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_196

## First error

../../components/feedback/feedback_report.cc:67:69: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
   67 |       reports_path_.AppendASCII(kFeedbackReportFilenamePrefix.data().subspan(
      |                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The code attempts to call `.subspan()` on the result of `.data()` on `kFeedbackReportFilenamePrefix`, which has been arrayified. The rewriter should have generated code to call `subspan` on the spanified return value.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to recognize spanified return values and correctly apply `.subspan()` calls to them.

## Note
This error occurred because the spanify tool incorrectly rewrote a C-style array to `std::array` and did not correctly update the usage of the array with `.data()`.
