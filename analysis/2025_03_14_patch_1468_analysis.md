# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1468

## First error

../../services/image_annotation/public/cpp/image_processor_unittest.cc:45:29: error: no viable conversion from 'uint8_t *' (aka 'unsigned char *') to 'const base::span<uint8_t>' (aka 'const span<unsigned char>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The code uses `SkBitmap::getPixels()` which returns a raw pointer (`uint8_t*`) but the rewriter is trying to assign it directly to a `base::span`. `base::span` does not have an implicit conversion from raw pointers; it needs to be constructed explicitly.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate a constructor call to `base::span` when assigning the result of `SkBitmap::getPixels()` to the `pixels` variable. Since the size is unknown in this situation, a dynamic span should be constructed using the correct pointer and size. The rewriter needs to compute the size.

```c++
const base::span<uint8_t> pixels = base::span(reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(out.getPixels()), out.getSize());
```

However, since `SkBitmap::getSize()` does not exist, the rewriter should use the height, width and bytes per pixel to determine the size of the span:

```c++
const base::span<uint8_t> pixels = base::span(reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(out.getPixels()), out.height() * out.rowBytes());
```

The rewriter should detect this pattern: assignment of a raw pointer return value from a third_party function to a span variable and generate the base::span construction with the correct size.

## Note
The failing test case in question is from a unit test for the ImageAnnotation Service, using `SkBitmap` (a Skia class) to generate a test bitmap. It would also be good to add this use case to the test suite for the rewriter itself.
