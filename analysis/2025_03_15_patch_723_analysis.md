## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code `dst_plane=dst_plane.subspan(rows * row_bytes)` is causing a compile
error because `rows * row_bytes` is of type `int`, while `subspan` expects an
unsigned type (size_t). The rewriter is not generating the necessary cast to
resolve this type mismatch. The error message `no matching function for call to
'strict_cast'` indicates that the `strict_cast` function from
`safe_conversions.h` cannot implicitly convert an `int` to a `size_t`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to insert a cast to `static_cast<size_t>` when calling
`subspan` with a signed integer expression. The generated code should be
`dst_plane=dst_plane.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(rows * row_bytes))`.

## Note
The second error is caused by the first error. Since the cast is missing the location reported by the second error is also wrong.
