# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1037

## First error

../../cc/metrics/event_metrics.cc:430:58: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('const std::array<base::TimeTicks, static_cast<int>(DispatchStage::kMaxValue) + 1>' and 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned long'))

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The code originally was using pointer arithmetic on `other.dispatch_stage_timestamps_`, which was a C-style array. The rewriter correctly changed the type to std::array, but failed to rewrite the pointer arithmetic to use `.data()` and `.subspan()`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to rewrite pointer arithmetic on the std::array to use .data() and .subspan(). The `std::copy` call should be rewritten to something like:

```c++
std::copy(other.dispatch_stage_timestamps_.data(),
                        other.dispatch_stage_timestamps_.data() +
                            static_cast<size_t>(last_dispatch_stage) + 1,
                        dispatch_stage_timestamps_.data()));
```

## Note
There were other functions that also had the same issue, but I only analyzed the first error.
