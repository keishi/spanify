# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1581

## First error

../../components/omnibox/browser/autocomplete_result_unittest.cc:353:30: error: out-of-line definition of 'SortMatchesAndVerifyOrder' does not match any declaration in 'AutocompleteResultTest'
  353 | void AutocompleteResultTest::SortMatchesAndVerifyOrder(
      |                              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified a function, but failed to spanify a call site. The function `AutocompleteResultTest::SortMatchesAndVerifyOrder` was modified to take a `base::span`, but the call site at line 1323 was not updated to provide a `base::span`.

## Solution
The rewriter should ensure that all call sites to a spanified function are updated to pass a `base::span`. In this case, the rewriter should update line 1323 to pass `base::span{data, std::size(data)}` instead of `data, std::size(data)`.

## Note
The second error is a consequence of the first error.
