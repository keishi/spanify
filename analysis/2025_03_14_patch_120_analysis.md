# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_120

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webcodecs/audio_data.cc:655:39: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<uint8_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned char>') to 'int16_t *' (aka 'short *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying pointer variables used in reinterpret_cast.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the `dest` variable which is of type `uint8_t*`. However, this variable is later used in a `reinterpret_cast` to `int16_t*`.  This causes a compile error because you cannot `reinterpret_cast` a span. The rewriter should have avoided spanifying this variable because it is used in a `reinterpret_cast`.

## Solution
The rewriter should check if a variable is being used in a `reinterpret_cast` before spanifying it. If it is, the rewriter should not spanify the variable.
```c++
-      int16_t* dest_data = reinterpret_cast<int16_t*>(dest.data());
+      base::span<int16_t> dest_data = reinterpret_cast<int16_t*>(dest);
```
should not have been changed.

## Note
There are no other errors in the log.
