# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_47

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/audio/cpu/x86/delay_sse2.cc:117:9: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'const __m128i *' to 'base::span<const __m128i, 1>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The code attempts to create a `base::span<const __m128i, 1>` from the address of `v_read_index1` using a direct initialization: `base::span<const __m128i, 1>(&v_read_index1)`. The error message indicates that there's no viable constructor for `base::span` that accepts a raw pointer to `__m128i` and implicitly converts it to a `base::span`. The problem is that the argument is wrapped in a `reinterpret_cast`. It's trying to create a `span` from an address, rather than from the variable itself.

The second error message indicates that it is trying to cast a span to a pointer, which is not allowed:
../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/audio/cpu/x86/delay_sse2.cc:116:46: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<const __m128i, 1>' to 'const uint32_t *' (aka 'const unsigned int *') is not allowed

## Solution
The rewriter should not be using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable. The rewriter should remove the reinterpret cast in the following line:
```c++
base::span<const uint32_t> read_index1 = reinterpret_cast<const uint32_t*>(
        base::span<const __m128i, 1>(&v_read_index1));
```
The rewriter can do the following:
```c++
base::span<const uint32_t> read_index1 = base::span<const uint32_t>((const uint32_t*)&v_read_index1, 4);
```
## Note
The code attempts to reinterpret_cast a `base::span<const __m128i, 1>` to `const uint32_t *`, which is not allowed. The original intention was likely to treat the `__m128i` variable as an array of `uint32_t`. This suggests that the rewriter isn't fully considering the implications of the types and data structures involved when spanifying the code. The .size() is also likely not correct here.
