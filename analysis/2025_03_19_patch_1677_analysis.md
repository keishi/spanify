## First error

../../components/metrics/file_metrics_provider_unittest.cc:338:25: error: no viable conversion from 'std::nullptr_t' to 'base::raw_span<const FileMetricsProvider::FilterAction, AllowPtrArithmetic>' (aka 'span<const FileMetricsProvider::FilterAction, dynamic_extent, raw_ptr<const FileMetricsProvider::FilterAction, (RawPtrTraits)8U | AllowPtrArithmetic>>')
  338 |       filter_actions_ = nullptr;
      |                         ^~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to nullptr initialization of spanified member field to {}.

## Reason
The code attempts to initialize a spanified member field `filter_actions_` with `nullptr`. The rewriter should have rewritten it to `{}`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to recognize nullptr initialization of spanified member field and rewrite it to use `{}`.

## Note
