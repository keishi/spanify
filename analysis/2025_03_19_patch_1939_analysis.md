# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1939

## First error

../../storage/common/file_system/file_system_util.cc:32:24: error: redefinition of 'kIsolatedDir' with a different type: 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') vs 'const char[]'

## Category
Overlapping replacements due to multiple variable declaration.

## Reason
The rewriter introduced a new variable `kIsolatedDir` with type `std::string_view` while there was already a variable defined with the same name with type `const char[]` in the header file `storage/common/file_system/file_system_util.h`. This resulted in a redefinition error.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid declaring new variables with the same names as existing variables. If a conversion is necessary, then existing variables should be modified instead of introducing new ones. In this specific case, the rewriter should have converted the existing `kIsolatedDir` to `std::string_view` instead of declaring a new variable with the same name.

## Note
There is a secondary error where the rewriter failed to add `.data()` when converting a C-style array to `base::span` in a third_party function call.

```
../../storage/common/file_system/file_system_util.cc:224:15: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'const char[]' to 'base::span<const char>'
  224 |       url += (base::span<const char>(kIsolatedDir)

```

The rewriter should add `.data()` to spanified `char[]` variable used with `std::string`
```
