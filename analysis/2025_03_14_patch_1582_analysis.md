# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1582

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code is attempting to use `subspan()` with `kWriteDataSize / 2` as the argument. The `strict_cast` in the `StrictNumeric` constructor is failing because it cannot implicitly convert a potentially signed `int` (the result of `kWriteDataSize / 2`) to an `unsigned long`. The subspan argument must be an unsigned value.

## Solution
The rewriter should add a cast to `static_cast<size_t>` or `static_cast<unsigned int>` to the argument when calling subspan().

Example:
```c++
base::span<const char>(kWriteData).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(kWriteDataSize / 2))
```

## Note
The other errors are caused by the same problem and will be fixed by the same change. The second error is:
```
../../google_apis/gcm/base/socket_stream_unittest.cc:410:24: error: no matching constructor for initialization of 'net::MockWrite' (aka 'MockReadWrite<MOCK_WRITE>')
  410 |   write_list.push_back(net::MockWrite(
```
This error stems from the fact that the call to MockWrite expects a `const char*` but receives `span<const char>`. This arises from the chained call to `subspan`. Casting the argument passed to `subspan` to a `size_t` will address this.
```c++
base::span<const char>(kWriteData).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(kWriteDataSize / 2))
```
In the last line, casting the argument resolves the issue.
```
../../google_apis/gcm/base/socket_stream_unittest.cc:503:24: error: no matching constructor for initialization of 'net::MockWrite' (aka 'MockReadWrite<MOCK_WRITE>')
```
Same fix applies here.
```c++
base::span<const char>(kWriteData).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(kWriteDataSize / 2))
