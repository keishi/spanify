# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_131

## First error

../../components/autofill/core/browser/geo/country_data.cc:320:38: error: no viable conversion from 'const char *const *' to 'base::span<const char *const>'

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The code is trying to construct a `base::span` from a C-style array returned by `icu::Locale::getISOCountries()`. The rewriter failed to identify the size of the array.

## Solution
The rewriter should have been able to handle this case correctly.

## Note
The error occurs in a loop condition where the span variable `country_pointer `is being incremented.
```c++
322 |       country_pointer[0]; UNSAFE_BUFFERS(++country_pointer)) {
```
This is a secondary error. The first error prevents the build from proceeding and needs to be addressed first.
