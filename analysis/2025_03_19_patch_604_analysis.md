# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_604

## First error

../../chrome/browser/segmentation_platform/service_browsertest.cc:339:41: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union

## Category
Rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The code was rewritten to:

```c++
kFeatureProcessingHistogram.data().subspan(
              SegmentIdToHistogramVariant(kSegmentId3))
```

`kFeatureProcessingHistogram.data()` returns a span. `subspan` should be called on the span object directly, not the underlying pointer. Thus the `.data()` is unnecessary.

## Solution
The rewriter shouldn't add `.data()` if the function call was already spanified.
```c++
       kFeatureProcessingHistogram.subspan(
              SegmentIdToHistogramVariant(kSegmentId3))
```

## Note
The second error is the same as the first.
