# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_213

## First error

../../components/feedback/redaction_tool/ip_address.h:61:51: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'const std::array<uint8_t, 16>' (aka 'const array<unsigned char, 16>') to function return type 'const base::span<uint8_t>' (aka 'const span<unsigned char>')
   61 |   const base::span<uint8_t> data() const { return bytes_; }
      |                                                   ^~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The original code had a member function `data()` that returned `uint8_t*`. The rewriter spanified the `bytes_` member to `std::array<uint8_t, 16>`. It then changed the return type of the `data()` member function to `base::span<uint8_t>`. However, it did not update the return statement in the body of the function to return a span, which can be constructed directly from the array, causing a type conversion error.

## Solution
The rewriter should update the return statement in the body of the `data()` function to return a span constructed from the `bytes_` array:

```c++
const base::span<uint8_t> data() const { return bytes_; }
```

## Note
The rewriter also introduced additional errors later in the build log, such as failing to add `.data()` when calling functions expecting raw pointers.
