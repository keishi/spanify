# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1112

## First error

third_party/blink/renderer/core/xml/xpath_grammar_generated.h:1440:35: error: expected expression
 1440 |     const std::array<signed char, > yypgoto_;
      |                                   ^

## Category
Rewriter is adding std::array without a specified size.

## Reason
The rewriter is converting `yypgoto_` to `std::array` in the header file. It seems that the original code had `static const signed char yypgoto_[];`, which does not specify the size of the array in the class definition, but in the .cc file, like this: `YyParser::yypgoto_[] = { ... };`. The rewriter needs to preserve that size.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to extract the size of the original array, and propagate to std::array. One way is to look for the initializer of yypgoto_ in the corresponding `.cc` file.

## Note
There are other errors related to the `yypgoto_` member after this first error. They will likely be resolved if the array is correctly rewritten.
