# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1944

## First error

../../media/formats/common/offset_byte_queue.cc:41:20: error: non-pointer operand type 'base::raw_span<const uint8_t, AllowPtrArithmetic | DanglingUntriaged>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char, dynamic_extent, raw_ptr<const unsigned char, (RawPtrTraits)9U | AllowPtrArithmetic>>') incompatible with nullptr
   41 |   *buf = size_ > 0 ? buf_ : nullptr;
      |                    ^ ~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to nullptr initialization of spanified member field to {}.

## Reason
The rewriter changed `buf_`'s type from raw pointer to `base::raw_span`.  The original code was assigning `nullptr` to it, but `base::raw_span` cannot be assigned `nullptr`. The correct way to initialize is to use `{}`

## Solution
The rewriter should replace `nullptr` with `{}`.

## Note
The rewriter could have added {.data() = nullptr, .size() = 0} but this is not necessary because default initialization of raw_span should do the same. Also, there is another error in this build log.
