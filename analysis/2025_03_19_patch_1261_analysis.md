## First error

../../ui/gfx/geometry/transform_unittest.cc:3972:28: error: member reference base type 'float[4]' is not a structure or union

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The compiler error indicates that the `.data()` method is being called on an object that is not a class or struct with a `data()` method. The code attempts to call `v4.data()` where `v4` is a `float[4]`, which is a C-style array, not a class or struct. The spanified code is trying to use `.data()` on a non-spanified `v4` variable, which is wrong.

## Solution
The rewriter should not have added `.data()` to `v4` because the surrounding expression isn't spanified. The rewriter should prevent adding `.data()` to code that it didn't spanify.

## Note
The diff shows the line `m.TransformVector4(v4.data());` was added as part of this patch. `TransformVector4` likely expects a `float*` but the rewriter failed to recognize this raw pointer and rewrite the function signature. There are other errors in the log, but this is the first.
