# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_16_patch_1480

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/audio/cpu/x86/delay_sse2.cc:117:9: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'const __m128i *' to 'base::span<const __m128i, 1>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to properly construct span from a variable.

## Reason
The code is trying to create a `base::span` from the address of a variable `v_read_index1`. The rewriter generated:
```c++
base::span<const uint32_t> read_index1 = reinterpret_cast<const uint32_t*>(
        base::span<const __m128i, 1>(&v_read_index1));
```

However, the span constructor does not allow such an argument.

## Solution
The rewriter should construct the span correctly from the variable.
```c++
base::span<const uint32_t, 4> read_index1(&v_read_index1.m128i_u32[0], 4);
```

## Note
A secondary error is "reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<const __m128i, 1>' to 'const uint32_t *' (aka 'const unsigned int *') is not allowed". This is a consequence of the first error.
