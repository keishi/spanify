# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1242

## First error

../../components/zucchini/patch_reader.cc:393:10: error: no matching function for call to 'CalculateCrc32'

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `CalculateCrc32` was spanified to accept a `base::span<const uint8_t>` as its first argument. The code is calling it with `old_image.begin()` which returns a raw pointer `const uint8_t*`. The compiler cannot implicitly convert the raw pointer to a `base::span`. The rewriter did not update the call site to construct a span from the iterator range.

## Solution
The rewriter should convert the arguments `old_image.begin()` and `old_image.end()` into a span. It also needs to update the argument `new_image.begin()` and `new_image.end()` on line 398. The fix would look like this:

```c++
zucchini::CalculateCrc32(base::span<const uint8_t>(old_image.data(), old_image.size()), old_image.end()) == header_.old_crc;
```

However, a better solution would be to use a span for the second argument of `CalculateCrc32` and change the implementation to use the span size to avoid providing the end iterator like so:
```c++
uint32_t CalculateCrc32(base::span<const uint8_t> first) {
  uint32_t ret = 0xFFFFFFFF;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < first.size(); ++i)
    ret = kCrc32Table[(ret ^ first[i]) & 0xFF] ^ (ret >> 8);
  return ret ^ 0xFFFFFFFF;
}
```

Then the code would change to:
```c++
zucchini::CalculateCrc32(old_image) == header_.old_crc;
```

## Note
The same error happens in other call sites in this patch.
