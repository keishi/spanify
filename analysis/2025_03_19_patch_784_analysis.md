# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_784

## First error

../../components/headless/screen_info/headless_screen_info.cc:220:41: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
  220 |         return kInvalidScreenInfo.data().subspan(leftover_text);
      |                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `kInvalidScreenInfo` to `std::array<char, 22>`, and then correctly added `.data()` to access the underlying C-style array. However, the return value of `.data()` (which is a `char*`) was then being used with `.subspan()`, which is incorrect. `.subspan()` is intended to be used with `base::span` objects, not raw pointers. The rewriter should have applied the `.subspan()` call to the spanified variable (`kInvalidScreenInfo.data()`), but failed to do so.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize that it spanified `kInvalidScreenInfo`, and when `.data()` is being accessed apply all subspan rewrites to the result.

## Note
There are multiple errors that are related to similar rewrite failures. All of them are related to using `.subspan()` on a `char*`.
