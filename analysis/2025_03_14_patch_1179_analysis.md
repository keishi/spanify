# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_14_patch_1179

## First error

../../cc/paint/paint_cache_unittest.cc:97:41: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<uint32_t, 1>' (aka 'span<unsigned int, 1>')
   97 |       service_cache.Purge(GetType(), 1, base::span<uint32_t, 1>(&id));
      |                                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to construct a span from a raw pointer.

## Reason
The rewriter has transformed a function signature to take a `base::span` argument, however the call sites were not updated to construct a `base::span` from the raw pointer.

The original code is:
```c++
service_cache.Purge(GetType(), 1, &id);
```

The rewriter converted the function declaration:
```c++
void ServicePaintCache::Purge(PaintCacheDataType type, size_t n, base::span<const volatile PaintCacheId> ids) 
```
Now requires `ids` to be `base::span`. `&id` has the type of `uint32_t*` which cannot be implicitly converted to `base::span<uint32_t, 1>`.

## Solution
The rewriter should construct a `base::span` from the raw pointer.

```c++
service_cache.Purge(GetType(), 1, base::span<const volatile PaintCacheId>(&id, 1));
```

## Note
The same error happened in a different location:
```
../../gpu/command_buffer/service/raster_decoder.cc:2783:55: error: no matching function for call to 'cc::ServicePaintCache::Purge(cc::PaintCacheDataType, int, base::span<const volatile unsigned int>)'
