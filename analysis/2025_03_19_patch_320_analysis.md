# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_320

## First error

../../third_party/googletest/src/googletest/include/gtest/gtest.h:1478:28: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('float *const' and 'const base::span<const float>')
 1478 | GTEST_IMPL_CMP_HELPER_(GE, >=)

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The error arises in `audio_bus_unittest.cc` when comparing a `float *const` with a `base::span<const float>`. The `EXPECT_GE` macro internally utilizes the `>=` operator, which is not directly defined for these two types. The rewriter has spanified the return value of `data()` calls, but the comparison operator is still being used between a raw pointer and a span. The type conversion between the two is not happening automatically. The rewriter spanified one side of the comparision, but did not spanify the other side.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to consistently handle raw pointers and spans at comparison sites. When a comparison involves a spanified variable and a raw pointer, it should either spanify the raw pointer or convert the span to a raw pointer by calling `.data()`. In this case, since the right operand is the result of `data()`, the left side `bus->channel_span(0).data()` should also be converted to spans.

## Note

The core issue revolves around the interaction between the spanified variables and the existing comparison logic within gtest's EXPECT_GE macro.
