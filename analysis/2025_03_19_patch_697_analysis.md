# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_697

## First error

../../base/profiler/stack_copier_signal.cc:250:61: error: cannot initialize a member subobject of type 'const uint8_t **' (aka 'const unsigned char **') with an rvalue of type 'base::span<const uint8_t> *' (aka 'span<const unsigned char> *')

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The code was attempting to pass `stack_copy_bottom`, now a `base::span<const uint8_t>`, as a `const uint8_t**` to `GetRegistersToRewrite`. This is an incompatible type conversion, and the rewriter failed to account for the type change in the surrounding code.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid applying changes that require casts between `base::span` and `uint8_t**`. Ideally, it should recognize that the argument type to `GetRegistersToRewrite` is incompatible with the spanified return type and refrain from making the change, or generate a compilation error.
Or potentially, add span support to thread_delegate_->GetRegistersToRewrite.

## Note
The second error indicates that `reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(stack_copy_bottom)` is invalid. The solution is likely related to the first error. The correct way is to access it via the `.data()` method, and that value can then be cast. However, this change is not correct either because subspan expects a number. The original code was performing pointer arithmetic on the pointer and comparing it to integers, which will now be wrong. The rewriter needs to undo everything here.
```c++
 *stack_top = reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(stack_copy_bottom.data()) +
                  (stack_base_address - bottom);
```

There is a high likelihood that the rewriter is not handling `*stack_top` correctly, which is a pointer to `void*`, which the code may cast to before doing arithmetic. It is possible the rewriter is not recognizing this pattern, so there should be more checks on how this code is being used.
