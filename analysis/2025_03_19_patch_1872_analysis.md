# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1872

## First error

../../base/allocator/partition_allocator/src/partition_alloc/pointers/raw_ptr.h:781:22: error: no matching function for call to 'Retreat'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid pointer arithmetic on base::raw_span.

## Reason
The rewriter replaced `QuerySync* syncs` with `base::raw_span<QuerySync, AllowPtrArithmetic> syncs`. The original code then used pointer arithmetic on `syncs` to get a pointer to an element within the shared memory region managed by the fenced allocator using this expression: `this->syncs + pending.index;`. However, because `syncs` is now a `base::raw_span`, the `+` operator no longer performs pointer arithmetic; instead, it expects a `Retreat` function to be defined that operates on spans, which doesn't exist in this case.

## Solution
Avoid pointer arithmetic on `base::raw_span`. Instead, the `.data()` method should be used to get a raw pointer, to which the arithmetic can be safely applied, and then wrap the pointer with raw_ptr. The line
```c++
QuerySync* sync = this->syncs + pending.index;
```
should be rewritten to:
```c++
QuerySync* sync = this->syncs.data() + pending.index;
```

## Note
Several other errors also result from this same incorrect span arithmetic. The fix should address them all.

Also this line was added to query_tracker.h

```c++
#include "base/memory/raw_span.h"
```

It's ok, but ideally the rewriter should only add the header if actually needed.
