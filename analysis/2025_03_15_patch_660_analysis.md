## First error

../../ui/events/velocity_tracker/velocity_tracker.cc:97:22: error: cannot increment value of type 'base::span<const float>'
   97 |     r += *(a++) * ((b++)[0]);
      |                     ~^

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The `VectorDot` function was spanified, but the loop within the function attempts to increment the `b` parameter (which is now a `base::span<const float>`). Incrementing a span directly is not a valid operation.

## Solution
The rewriter should not only update function definitions but also ensure that all call sites and all uses within a function are compatible with the spanified parameters. Here, instead of incrementing the span, the code should access elements within the span using an index.

## Note
The other two errors stem from the same root cause of type mismatch after spanification of the function.
