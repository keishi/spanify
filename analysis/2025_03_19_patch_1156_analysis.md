## First error

../../ui/gfx/color_utils.cc:183:27: error: no viable conversion from 'const float *' to 'base::span<const float>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified `find_nearest_lum_it`, which returned a `const float*`. This raw pointer is then assigned to a `base::span<const float>`, which is an incompatible type.

```c++
- const float* src_it = find_nearest_lum_it(GetRelativeLuminance(color));
+ base::span<const float> src_it =
+     find_nearest_lum_it(GetRelativeLuminance(color));
```

The rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the returned pointer. However, it is hard to identify the size of that span.

## Solution
The rewriter should generate code to create a span from the raw pointer returned by `find_nearest_lum_it`.

```c++
base::span<const float> src_it(find_nearest_lum_it(GetRelativeLuminance(color)), 1);
```

## Note

Several other errors stem from the incorrect span construction and subsequent usage, such as:

*   `../../ui/gfx/color_utils.cc:284:25: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('const float *' and 'base::span<const float>')`
*   `../../ui/gfx/color_utils.cc:284:45: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<const float>' and 'int')`
*   `../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'`

These errors would likely be resolved by correctly handling the initial span construction.
