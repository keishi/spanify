# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1930

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The rewriter is generating code that passes a signed integer value as an argument to the `base::span::subspan()` method, but the method expects an unsigned value. The error message "no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'" indicates that the rewriter needs to explicitly cast the signed integer to an unsigned type before passing it to `subspan()`.

## Solution
The rewriter logic should be changed to insert an explicit cast to `static_cast<size_t>()` around the signed integer argument when calling `base::span::subspan()`. For example, the code:
`source = source.subspan(4);`

should be transformed to:
`source = source.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(4));`

## Note
There are many other errors in the build log related to type mismatches between `base::span<const SourceType>` and `const SourceType*`.  These are secondary errors that will likely be resolved by fixing the initial type mismatch. The more general underlying issue is that the rewriter is spanifying function parameters, but failing to update function call sites to pass spans instead of raw pointers.
