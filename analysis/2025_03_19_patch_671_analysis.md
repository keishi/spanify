# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_671

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code calls `.subspan(i)` where `i` is a signed integer. The subspan function requires an unsigned integer. The rewriter should have added a cast to `static_cast<size_t>(i)` to convert the signed integer to an unsigned integer.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to cast the argument to `subspan()` to an unsigned value using `static_cast<size_t>()`.
