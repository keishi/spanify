# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_71

## First error

../../media/renderers/paint_canvas_video_renderer_unittest.cc:491:43: error: reinterpret_cast from 'HeapArray<unsigned char, AlignedFreeDeleter>' to 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') is not allowed
  491 |   base::span<const uint32_t> rgb_pixels = reinterpret_cast<uint32_t*>(memory);

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter converted the heap allocated memory buffer (`memory`) into a `base::span` but it failed to remove the `reinterpret_cast` that was using the raw pointer, which is invalid code. The variable `memory` has been spanified.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be able to remove the `reinterpret_cast` when spanifying a variable. This can be done by finding the corresponding cast expression and modifying/removing it during the rewrite process.
