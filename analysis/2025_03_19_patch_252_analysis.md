# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_252

## First error

../../device/bluetooth/floss/floss_dbus_client.cc:382:31: error: cannot initialize a parameter of type 'const uint8_t **' (aka 'const unsigned char **') with an rvalue of type 'base::span<const uint8_t> *' (aka 'span<const unsigned char> *')
  382 |   if (reader->PopArrayOfBytes(&bytes, &length)) {
      |                               ^~~~~~
../../dbus/message.h:443:40: note: passing argument to parameter 'bytes' here

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The code attempts to pass the address of a `base::span<const uint8_t>` variable to the `PopArrayOfBytes` function, which expects a `const uint8_t**`. This is an invalid conversion, as the rewriter simply replaces the original pointer with a span, without updating the function call to properly access the underlying data. It seems the original code used to work by having `bytes` point directly to the data buffer, and `&bytes` was how to pass a pointer that can be changed. Now that `bytes` is a span, `&bytes` is a pointer to a span, and there's no implicit conversion from that to `const uint8_t**`.

## Solution
The rewriter should have created a temporary pointer variable to pass to the function, and then use the span variable to get pointer information for it, and pass it as an argument. Something like this:

```c++
  const uint8_t* bytes_ptr = bytes.data();
  if (reader->PopArrayOfBytes(&bytes_ptr, &length)) {
    // ...
  }
```
## Note
The rewriter is failing to handle the address of the span variable.
