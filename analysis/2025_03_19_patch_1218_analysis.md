# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1218

## First error

../../media/gpu/h264_builder_unittest.cc:28:13: error: use of undeclared identifier 'scaling_list4x4'

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
In H264BuilderTest::H264BuilderTest, the rewriter incorrectly added `.data()` to `sps.scaling_list4x4` even though it's operating on a local variable `sps` of type `H264SPS`. It should only be adding .data() if the member scaling_list4x4 was arrayified, but H264SPS::scaling_list4x4 is still a raw array.

## Solution
The logic for adding `.data()` should be refined to only do so when actually converting the type of the member field to std::array or base::span.

## Note
The include in `media/parsers/h264_parser.cc` is also suspicious since it is in the middle of the file not at the top where includes normally are.
