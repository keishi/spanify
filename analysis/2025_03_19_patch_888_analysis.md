# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_888

## First error

../../components/omnibox/browser/history_quick_provider_performance_unittest.cc:65:37: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
   65 |   URLRow row{GURL(kPopularUrl.data().subspan(fake_hash))};
      |                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The code attempts to call `.subspan()` on `kPopularUrl.data()`, but the tool failed to recognize that `.data()` is returning `base::span<char>`.

## Solution
The span rewriter should be able to recognize a `base::span` returned by the `.data()` method and rewrite it correctly. In this case, it should generate code to rewrite `kPopularUrl.data().subspan(fake_hash)` into `kPopularUrl.data().subspan(fake_hash).data()`.

## Note
This looks like a classic rewriter bug.
