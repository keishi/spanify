## First error

../../net/http/http_util.cc:310:7: error: suggest braces around initialization of subobject [-Werror,-Wmissing-braces]
  310 |       "Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"};
      |       ^~~~~
      |       {    }

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The compiler is complaining about missing braces around the initialization of subobjects within the `kWeekdayName` array. This is likely due to the change from a C-style array to `std::array`. The compiler wants explicit braces to initialize each inner array of `char`. This means that rewriter should not have modified this code.

## Solution
The rewriter should not be touching unrelated code. The rewriter should be modified to only change code it spanified or arrayified.

## Note
The rest of the errors about missing braces are the same as the first error.

The subsequent errors in `../../third_party/abseil-cpp/absl/strings/internal/str_format/arg.h` and `../../net/http/http_util.cc` indicate that the `base::StringPrintf` function is not compatible with `std::array<char, 4>`. The rewriter should recognize that the `char[]` is being passed to `base::StringPrintf` and add `.data()` to the `char[]` converted to `std::array`, reusing the category "Rewriter needs to add .data() to `char[]` converted to std::array passed to `base::StringPrintf`." But this is not the first error.
