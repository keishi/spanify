# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1041

## First error

../../ui/gfx/skbitmap_operations.cc:84:26: error: no viable conversion from 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<uint32_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned int>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The code is calling `first.getAddr32(0, y)` which returns a raw `uint32_t*`. The rewriter is then attempting to assign this raw pointer to a `base::span<uint32_t>`. However, `getAddr32` is a third-party function (from Skia) so the rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from this return value.

## Solution
The rewriter should wrap the call to `first.getAddr32(0, y)` in a `base::span`. This requires the rewriter to determine the correct size for the span. Since the size of each row is `first.width()`, the rewriter should generate:

```c++
base::span<uint32_t> first_row(first.getAddr32(0, y), first.width());
```

## Note
The `SkBitmap::getAddr32` function is from Skia, which is third-party code. The source for `SkBitmap::getAddr32` is below.

```c++
uint32_t* SkBitmap::getAddr32(int x, int y) const {
    if ((unsigned)x >= (unsigned)fWidth || (unsigned)y >= (unsigned)fHeight) {
        return nullptr;
    }
    return fPixels ? fBaseAddr + y * fRowBytes + x * 4 : nullptr;
}
