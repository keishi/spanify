## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter is adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_autogen.h`. But this header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition, because the autogenerated file contains only declarations inside the class, not definitions.

## Solution
Avoid adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` inside class declarations in header files. Only add the include to source files where the span is actually used. In this case, move `#include "base/containers/span.h"` to `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_implementation.cc`.

## Note
There are other errors but they are likely caused by this first error.
