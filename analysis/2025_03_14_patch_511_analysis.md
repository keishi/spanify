## First error

../../components/headless/screen_info/headless_screen_info.cc:173:40: error: member reference base type 'const value_type *' (aka 'const char *') is not a structure or union
  173 |   return kUnknownScreenInfoParam.data().subspan(std)::string(key);
      |          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The rewriter attempted to use both `.data()` and `.subspan()` on the same variable. Specifically, it seems that the tool added `.data()` to the `kUnknownScreenInfoParam` variable (which is now an `std::array`), and then incorrectly tried to call `.subspan()` on the result of the `.data()` call, resulting in invalid C++ syntax.

## Solution
The rewriter should be updated to correctly chain `.data()` and `.subspan()` when converting `char[]` to `std::array`. The correct code should use `subspan` correctly on array, instead of adding data() before subspan.

## Note
The compiler output shows subsequent syntax errors caused by the incorrect `.subspan()` call:

*   `unexpected namespace name 'std': expected expression`
*   `expected ';' after return statement`
