# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_03_19_patch_1947

## First error

../../components/gwp_asan/client/sampling_malloc_shims_unittest.cc:206:29: error: no viable conversion from 'unsigned char *' to 'base::span<unsigned char>'
  206 |   base::span<unsigned char> new_alloc =
      |                             ^
  207 |       static_cast<unsigned char*>(realloc(alloc, base::GetPageSize() + 1));

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The rewriter is converting a raw pointer to a `base::span<unsigned char>`. However, it's failing to recognize that the pointer is being initialized by the return value of `realloc`, for which there is no size information available. Since the rewriter does not have the information about the size that the pointer points to, it cannot convert it to `base::span<unsigned char>`.

## Solution
The rewriter should be able to detect when a raw pointer is being assigned to a value of an unknown size. In such cases, it shouldn't attempt to convert the variable into `base::span<unsigned char>`.

## Note
The other error is:
```
../../components/gwp_asan/client/sampling_malloc_shims_unittest.cc:209:51: error: no viable conversion from 'base::span<unsigned char>' to 'const void *'
  209 |   CHECK_EQ(GetMallocGpaForTesting().PointerIsMine(new_alloc), false);
      |                                                   ^~~~~~~~~
```

This error indicates that after converting `new_alloc` to a span, the code is trying to pass it as a `const void*` to the `PointerIsMine` function. This conversion is not directly supported for `base::span`, and thus requires calling `data()`.
