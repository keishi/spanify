## First error

../../net/filter/zstd_source_stream_unittest.cc:94:40: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'net::IOBufferWithSize' to function return type 'base::span<char>'

## Category
Rewriter failed to handle cast of single variable span.

## Reason
The rewriter changed the return type of `out_data()` to `base::span<char>`, but the function attempts to return `*out_buffer_`, which is of type `net::IOBufferWithSize`. There is no implicit conversion from `net::IOBufferWithSize` to `base::span<char>`.

## Solution
The rewriter should have also modified the return statement to create the appropriate span. The original code likely intended to return a span over the underlying buffer in the `IOBufferWithSize`. The correct return would be `return base::make_span(out_buffer_->data(), out_buffer_->size());`. This requires adding `#include "base/memory/ptr_util.h"`.

## Note
The rewriter correctly added `.data()` in other places.
