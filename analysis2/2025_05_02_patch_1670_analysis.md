# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1670

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_stub.h:14:7: error: missing '}' at end of definition of 'gpu::gles2::GLES2InterfaceStub'

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The compiler error "missing '}' at end of definition" combined with the subsequent errors about `std` namespace issues indicate that the `base/containers/span.h` header, included by the rewriter, is causing a syntax error when included in `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_stub.h`.
The `span.h` header transitively includes system headers, which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in header files. Specifically, in this case, it should avoid including it in `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_stub.h`.
Alternatively, the rewriter could add the include in the `.cc` file instead of the `.h` file.

## Note
The error arises from including `<algorithm>` which then leads to a cascade of errors related to the standard library. The root cause is the attempt to include `span.h` in the header file.
