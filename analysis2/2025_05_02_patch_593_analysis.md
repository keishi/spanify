# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_593

## First error

Overlapping replacements: ./media/formats/mp4/es_descriptor_unittest.cc at offset 1473, length 14: "(buffer.size() * sizeof(decltype(buffer)::value_type))" and offset 1479, length 0: ".data()"

## Category
Overlapping replacements between RewriteArraySizeof and AppendDataCall.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to add both a `.data()` call and rewrite `sizeof(buffer)` at nearly the same location. This results in overlapping replacements because the `.data()` call is added to the rewritten `buffer` variable in the `data.assign()` method, but the `sizeof` is also being rewritten to use the array size.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid rewriting the `sizeof(buffer)` expression within the `data.assign()` call after adding the `.data()` call. The replacements are overlapping and causing a conflict.

## Note
The error message clearly indicates that the overlapping replacements are happening in `media/formats/mp4/es_descriptor_unittest.cc`.
