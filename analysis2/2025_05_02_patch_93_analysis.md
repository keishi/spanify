## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan` method of `base::span` requires an unsigned integer as its argument. The `transfered` variable is of type `ssize_t` which is a signed integer. The compiler is complaining about the implicit conversion.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate code that casts the `transfered` variable to `size_t` before calling `subspan`.

```
-    buffer = buffer.subspan(transfered);
+    buffer = buffer.subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(transfered));
```
Also add the corresponding include.

```
+#include "base/numerics/safe_conversions.h"
