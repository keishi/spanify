## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The error message "suggest braces around initialization of subobject" indicates that the compiler is expecting an additional set of braces around the initialization of the `SkV4` objects. This is due to the change from a C-style array to a `std::array`. The nested structure requires explicit initialization of the inner arrays/structs.

The root cause of this error is that the spanifier converted a C-style array to a `std::array` in a unittest. However, since it's a unittest, we should not be rewriting the code automatically. The spanifier should be able to identify code that we don't want to rewrite.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Note
The diff reveals that the rewriter has changed the declaration of `expected_yuvs` from a C-style array to a `std::array`. This change is what causes the compiler to expect additional braces around the initialization of the `SkV4` objects. The other error messages also relate to the array changes.
