# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1143

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan()` method requires an unsigned integer type as its argument. In the code, the variable `i` is an `int`, which is a signed integer type. The `strict_cast` function enforces safe conversions and rejects implicit conversions from signed to unsigned integers.

## Solution
The rewriter should wrap the argument `i` with `base::checked_cast<size_t>()` to explicitly cast it to an unsigned integer type before passing it to the `subspan()` method. This requires including the header file `base/numerics/safe_conversions.h`.

```c++
// Original code:
UNSAFE_TODO({ start = start.subspan(i); });

// Corrected code:
UNSAFE_TODO({ start = start.subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(i)); });
```

Additionally, the header `base/numerics/safe_conversions.h` should be included:

```c++
#include "base/numerics/safe_conversions.h"
```

## Note
The `UNSAFE_TODO` macro expands to `UNSAFE_BUFFERS`, which does not prevent the compilation from failing.
