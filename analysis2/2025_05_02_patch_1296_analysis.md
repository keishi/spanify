## First error

```
../../chrome/common/profiler/thread_profiler_configuration.cc:209:36: error: no viable conversion from 'const ThreadProfilerConfiguration::Variation *' to 'base::span<const Variation>'
  209 |   for (base::span<const Variation> it = variations.begin(); it != last_item;
      |                                    ^    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The code is trying to initialize a `base::span` with a raw pointer (`variations.begin()`). The `base::span` constructor used in the rewritten code requires a range, not just a raw pointer. The rewriter should have kept the original iterator based loop or constructed a `base::span` with the correct size information.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to recognize that `variations.begin()` returns a pointer and use the appropriate `base::span` constructor or avoid rewriting the loop to use iterators. In this case, the simplest solution is to not rewrite the loop.
