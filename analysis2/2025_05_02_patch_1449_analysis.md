# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1449

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/tests/gl_copy_texture_CHROMIUM_unittest.cc:342:9: error: reinterpret_cast from 'std::vector<uint8_t>' (aka 'vector<unsigned char>') to 'uint16_t *' (aka 'unsigned short *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `uint16_t* texture_data16` to `base::span<uint16_t> texture_data16`, but the code still contains a `reinterpret_cast` using `*texture_data` which is of type `std::vector<uint8_t>`. `std::vector` cannot be directly casted to another type with `reinterpret_cast`. The rewriter should have either removed the `reinterpret_cast` or made the cast to `.data()`.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid applying `reinterpret_cast` directly to a spanified variable. Use the `.data()` method on the spanified variable to convert the expression to a raw pointer before casting.

```c++
-   base::span<uint16_t> texture_data16 =
-       reinterpret_cast<uint16_t*>(*texture_data);
+   base::span<uint16_t> texture_data16 =
+       reinterpret_cast<uint16_t*>(texture_data->data());
```

However, this fix is incomplete since the underlying type `std::vector<uint8_t>` is not cast to a `uint16_t` array. The cast is unsafe. The rewriter should not perform the spanification if this unsafe cast cannot be addressed. The rewriter should avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.
