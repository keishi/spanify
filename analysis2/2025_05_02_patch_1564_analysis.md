## First error

../../components/compose/core/browser/compose_metrics.cc:33:24: error: redefinition of 'kComposeSessionDialogShownCount' with a different type: 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') vs 'const char[]'

## Category
Rewriter redefined a variable with a different type, causing a compilation error.

## Reason
The rewriter incorrectly changed the type of `kComposeSessionDialogShownCount` from `const char[]` (declared in the header file) to `const std::string_view` in the source file. This is a redefinition with a conflicting type, which the compiler flags as an error. The header file declares it as `extern const char kComposeSessionDialogShownCount[];` and the `.cc` file defines it, so the rewriter should have only changed it in the `.h` file.

## Solution
The rewriter should verify that the variable being rewritten is not declared `extern` in the header file. If it is, the rewriter should only change the declaration in the header file and not the definition in the `.cc` file. Alternatively, the rewriter could check if the variable is already defined in the header file. If so, it should not redefine it in the source file. The rewriter should also check if the variable is used in the same translation unit or a different one. If it is a different translation unit, the `extern` declaration should be preserved.

## Note
The second error is a consequence of the first error. It occurs because the code attempts to call `.data()` on `kComposeSessionDialogShownCount`, which is now a `const char[]` rather than a `std::string_view`. This code expects a `std::string_view` to have a `.data()` method.
