## First error

../../media/base/vector_math_perftest.cc:206:24: error: cannot initialize a parameter of type 'void (*)(const float *, int, float *)' with an lvalue of type 'void (base::span<const float>, int, float *)': type mismatch at 1st parameter ('const float *' vs 'base::span<const float>')

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `vector_math::FCLAMP_C` was spanified, but the benchmark code in `vector_math_perftest.cc` still expects the original function signature with a raw pointer `const float*`. The `RunClampingBenchmark` function takes a function pointer with the old signature, causing a type mismatch when `vector_math::FCLAMP_C` (which now takes `base::span`) is passed as an argument.  The rewriter spanified a function but did not update a call site that passes a function pointer.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to identify all call sites to spanified functions, including cases where the function is passed as a function pointer. The rewriter should update the call sites to be compatible with the new signature of the function. In this case, `RunClampingBenchmark` must be updated to handle spanified `FCLAMP_C`, or a wrapper needs to be generated. The simplest solution is to update the signature of RunClampingBenchmark to take a base::span.

## Note
The rewriter introduced a span parameter to FCLAMP_C, which is good, but the existing code wasn't updated to support the new function signature.
