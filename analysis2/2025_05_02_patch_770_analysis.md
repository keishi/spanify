## First error

```
../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webaudio/periodic_wave.cc:276:7: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<__m128, 1>' to 'float *' is not allowed
  276 |       reinterpret_cast<float*>(base::span<__m128, 1>(&v_ratio, 1u));
      |       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The code attempts to `reinterpret_cast` a `base::span<__m128, 1>` to a `float*`. This type of cast is generally unsafe and disallowed. The rewriter introduced the `base::span` but didn't remove the `reinterpret_cast`, leading to the error.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to either remove the `reinterpret_cast` entirely or replace it with a safe alternative, such as using `.data()` to get a raw pointer and then casting that. However, depending on the context, the best solution might be to avoid the need for the cast altogether by operating on the data within the `base::span` directly or copying the data to a suitable type. In this case, since the original code was `const float* ratio = reinterpret_cast<float*>(&v_ratio);`, and `v_ratio` is a local variable, it is very simple to remove the `reinterpret_cast`.

## Note
The original code was using `reinterpret_cast` on a stack allocated variable. This is not ideal, and it is preferable to avoid such casts.
