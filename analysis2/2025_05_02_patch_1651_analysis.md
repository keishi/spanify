## First error
../../chrome/browser/autocomplete/search_provider_unittest.cc:3205:13: error: suggest braces around initialization of subobject [-Werror,-Wmissing-braces]

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid brace elision with std::array when initializing subobjects.

## Reason
The code is attempting to initialize a `std::array<Match, 5>` with an initializer list, where `Match` is a struct. The compiler is suggesting braces around the initialization of the `Match` subobjects. This means that when rewriting to use std::array the rewriter is not preserving the brace elision, causing the compiler error.  The rewriter incorrectly assumes that braces can be elided for `std::array` initialization.  In this case Match itself is an aggregate that requires braces.

## Solution
The rewriter should inspect the type of the element being initialized in the init list and ensure that braces are not elided when the type is an aggregate type.  The logic in `CanElideBracesForStdArrayInitialization` needs to account for aggregate types.

## Note
The other errors all stem from the same root cause, the rewriter not preserving the correct initialization syntax.
