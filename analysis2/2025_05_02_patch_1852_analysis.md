# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1852

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
../../base/values_unittest.cc:1572:67: note: in instantiation of function template specialization 'base::internal::StrictNumeric<unsigned long>::StrictNumeric<int>' requested here
 1572 |       stack_buffer.data(), base::span<char>(stack_buffer).subspan(42).data()));
      |                                                                   ^

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan()` method requires an unsigned integer as its argument. The code uses a signed integer (42) directly as the argument to `subspan()`.  The `strict_cast` is failing because it can't implicitly convert the signed integer to an unsigned integer in a constexpr context without a potential overflow.

## Solution
The rewriter should cast the argument to `subspan()` to `size_t` to ensure that it is an unsigned integer.  For example:

```c++
base::span<char>(stack_buffer).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(42))
```

## Note
The second error is due to using ASSERT_NE on `std::array` and `const char*`. This is not caused by the spanification rewrite itself, but rather how the tool chose to use the span. The first error must be fixed first.
