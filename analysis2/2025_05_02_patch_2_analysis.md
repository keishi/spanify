## First error

```
../../components/reporting/storage/storage_unittest.cc:995:31: error: expected expression
  995 |                .subspan(sizeof)
      |                               ^
```

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to use both `.data()` and `.subspan()` on the `value_to_sign` variable after converting it to a `std::array`. The code tries to call `.subspan(sizeof)` which is not a valid use of subspan. It also adds `.data()` in the middle of a call to subspan which is also invalid. This suggests a conflict in how the rewriter is applying these replacements.

## Solution
The rewriter logic needs to be refined to correctly handle the combination of `.data()` and `.subspan()`. The intent seems to be to copy `public_value` into a sub-region of the `value_to_sign` array. The subspan argument must be a size and not just `sizeof`.

```c++
 memcpy(base::span<uint8_t>(value_to_sign)
               .subspan(sizeof(Encryptor::PublicKeyId), kKeySize)
               .data(),
           public_value, kKeySize);
```

## Note
The second error compounds the issue, further demonstrating the incorrect placement of `.data()`.
