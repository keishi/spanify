# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1159

## First error

../../media/cdm/aes_decryptor_unittest.cc:317:24: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') to 'base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>')

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize `std::string_view` to `base::span<uint8_t>` conversion.

## Reason
The code is trying to construct a `base::span<const uint8_t>` from a `std::string_view`. `std::string_view` holds character data, while `base::span<const uint8_t>` represents a span of unsigned 8-bit integers. Since the underlying data is conceptually similar, a conversion should be possible, but is failing in this case.

## Solution
The rewriter should be able to convert `std::string_view` to `base::span<const uint8_t>` by using `reinterpret_cast` in the code.

```c++
base::span<const uint8_t>(reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(kOriginalData.data()), kOriginalData.size())
```

## Note
There are other errors related to type conversion from `const char*` to `const std::vector<uint8_t>`.
