## First error

../../net/base/file_stream_unittest.cc:81:5: error: no matching function for call to 'WriteFile'

## Category
Rewriter needs to add .data() when converting a C-style array to std::array in a third_party function call.

## Reason
The code now passes `kTestData` (which has been converted to `std::array`) to `base::WriteFile`. `base::WriteFile` expects a `span<const uint8_t>` or `std::string_view`, and there is no implicit conversion from `std::array` to either of these types. The rewriter should have added `.data()` to pass a pointer to the underlying data buffer.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to append `.data()` when a `std::array` is passed to `base::WriteFile`.

```c++
base::WriteFile(temp_file_path_, kTestData.data());
```

## Note
The third error is:

```
../../net/base/file_stream_unittest.cc:293:23: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('const std::array<char, 11>' and 'const int64_t' (aka 'const long'))
  293 |   EXPECT_EQ(kTestData + kOffset, data_read);
      |             ~~~~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~
```

The code attempts to add an offset to a `std::array`, which is not a valid operation. This is likely a secondary error that should be addressed after fixing the `base::WriteFile` issue.
