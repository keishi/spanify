# Build Failure: 2025_05_02_patch_784

## First error

```
../../media/gpu/vaapi/vaapi_jpeg_decoder.cc:56:22: error: use of undeclared identifier 'value'
   56 |                     (value.size() * sizeof(decltype(value)::value_type)),
      |                      ^~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The code tries to use `value.size()` but `value` is not defined in the scope. The code was trying to reference member `value` of JpegQuantizationTable, but it looks like the rewriter tried to apply the `.size()` addition outside the loop/context where `q_table` is actually accessed. The diff shows that the rewriter is trying to use the name `value` to refer to an array/span/std::array variable, and adding `.size()` to it, but it's doing so in the wrong place.

## Solution
Rewriter should check the context before adding `.size()` or `.data()`. Make sure it is actually referring to a spanified/arrayified variable/member, and that it's doing it in the correct scope.

## Note
Second error:
