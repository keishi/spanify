# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_973

## First error

../../cc/paint/paint_shader.cc:611:52: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<const SkColor4f>' (aka 'span<const SkRGBA4f<kUnpremul_SkAlphaType>>') and 'int')

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The `colors` parameter in `PaintShader::SetColorsAndPositions` was spanified. The code attempts to add an integer `count` to the span `colors`, which is invalid. The correct way to access the end of the span is `colors.data() + count`, but this requires subspan rewrite.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to rewrite `colors + count` to `colors.data() + count`, effectively calling subspan on the span.

## Note
None
