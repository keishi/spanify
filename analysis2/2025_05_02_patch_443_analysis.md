## Category
Rewriter needs to rewrite initializer lists for multi-dimensional arrays correctly.

## Reason
The rewriter converted a C-style array to a `std::array` but failed to add the necessary braces for initializing the subobjects in a multi-dimensional array. The compiler suggests adding braces around the initialization of the `SkV4` subobjects.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to analyze the initializer list and add braces around the subobjects when converting multi-dimensional C-style arrays to `std::array`. This involves identifying the structure of the initializer list and inserting the braces at the correct positions.

The code before the spanification looks like this:
```c++
  SkV4 expected_yuvs[kNumColorSpaces][kNumTestRGBs] = {
      // REC601
      {
          {0.3195f, 0.3518f, 0.9392f, 1.0000f},
          {0.5669f, 0.2090f, 0.1322f, 1.0000f},
```

Which means that SkV4 has four float members. The rewriter changed this to:
```c++
  std::array<std::array<SkV4, kNumTestRGBs>, kNumColorSpaces> expected_yuvs = {{
      // REC601
      {
          {0.3195f, 0.3518f, 0.9392f, 1.0000f},
          {0.5669f, 0.2090f, 0.1322f, 1.0000f},
```

The rewriter needs to add an extra `{}` around the subobjects to account for std::array of arrays. The correct code should be:

```c++
  std::array<std::array<SkV4, kNumTestRGBs>, kNumColorSpaces> expected_yuvs = {{{
      // REC601
      {{0.3195f, 0.3518f, 0.9392f, 1.0000f}},
      {{0.5669f, 0.2090f, 0.1322f, 1.0000f}},
```

## Note
The subsequent errors indicate "excess elements in struct initializer", which are a direct consequence of the missing braces in the first error. Once the braces are added, these errors should disappear.
