# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1501

## First error

../../base/functional/bind_internal.h:1603:21: error: static assertion failed: Type mismatch between bound argument and bound functor's parameter.

## Category
Rewriter needs to handle function binding with std::array/base::span arguments.

## Reason
The code attempts to bind a function that takes a `base::span<const int>` argument with a raw C-style array `int array[4]`. The `base::BindRepeating` and `base::BindOnce` functions are failing to deduce the correct types for the bound arguments. The static assertion in `bind_internal.h` indicates a type mismatch between the bound argument and the function's parameter type. This is because `base::BindRepeating` and `base::BindOnce` do not automatically convert a raw C-style array into a `base::span`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to automatically wrap the C-style array with `base::span` when binding it as an argument to a function expecting a `base::span`.

## Note
The error occurs in multiple places within the `bind_unittest.cc` file, specifically when using `BindRepeating` and `BindOnce` with the `ArrayGet` function.
