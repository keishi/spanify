## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The spanify tool added `#include "base/containers/span.h"` to `testing/libfuzzer/unittest_main.cc`. This file transitively includes `base/memory/raw_ptr_exclusion.h`, which includes `partition_alloc/pointers/raw_ptr_exclusion.h`. The include paths used by clang++ in this build configuration do not include the path to `partition_alloc/pointers/raw_ptr_exclusion.h`, resulting in the compilation failure.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid including `base/containers/span.h` in files where it's not strictly necessary, especially in files that might have unusual include path configurations. It is likely that `unittest_main.cc` does not require span directly, but only because of the change in `main`'s signature. Therefore the signature of main should not be rewritten.

## Note
The span.h include was likely added to facilitate the change to main's signature. The rewriter probably added span.h since it thought it was required.
