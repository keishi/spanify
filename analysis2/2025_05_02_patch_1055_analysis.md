# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1055

## First error

../../components/gwp_asan/crash_handler/crash_handler_unittest.cc:159:66: error: no viable conversion from 'crashpad::SanitizationAllowedMemoryRanges::Range *' to 'base::span<crashpad::SanitizationAllowedMemoryRanges::Range>'

## Category
Rewriter does not handle assignment of spanified variable from an allocation using new.

## Reason
The code allocates memory using `new crashpad::SanitizationAllowedMemoryRanges::Range[memory_ranges.size()]`, and attempts to assign the result to a spanified variable `range_array`. The rewriter is unable to handle this case because it requires using a smart pointer or a collection.

## Solution
The rewriter should not spanify variables that are assigned the result of a `new` allocation. This pattern requires further analysis to determine the correct ownership semantics. The code should be refactored to use a unique_ptr or a collection before spanification.

## Note
The second error `reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<crashpad::SanitizationAllowedMemoryRanges::Range>' to 'crashpad::VMAddress' (aka 'unsigned long') is not allowed` is a consequence of the first error.
