## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The code attempts to initialize a `base::span` directly with the raw pointer returned by `icu::Locale::getISOCountries()`. However, `base::span` requires the size of the array to be known at compile time or to be explicitly provided. In this case, the size is not directly available, leading to the "no viable conversion" error. The rewriter failed to deduce that the return value of this function is a null terminated array, and it should have used a manual span construction with a separate size calculation.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to recognize the `icu::Locale::getISOCountries()` pattern and construct a span with the correct size. Since the array is null-terminated, a possible solution would be to rewrite the loop as follows:

```c++
const char* const* country_array = icu::Locale::getISOCountries();
size_t country_count = 0;
while (country_array[country_count] != nullptr) {
  ++country_count;
}
base::span<const char* const> country_pointer(country_array, country_count);
for (; country_pointer[0]; UNSAFE_BUFFERS(++country_pointer)) {
  std::string country_code = country_pointer[0];
  if (!import_requirements.count(country_code)) {
    import_requirements.insert(std::make_pair(
        std::move(country_code),
        RequiredFieldsForAddressImport()));
  }
}
```

The rewriter needs logic to:
1.  Detect the use of `icu::Locale::getISOCountries()`.
2.  Insert code to calculate the number of elements in the returned array before creating the span.
3.  Replace the initialization of `country_pointer` with the span construction using the calculated size.
4.  Keep the subsequent logic using `country_pointer` unchanged.

## Note
The second error `cannot increment value of type 'base::span<const char *const>'` is caused by the first error. The original code increments a pointer, not a span, so this indicates that the original intention of incrementing the return pointer of `icu::Locale::getISOCountries()` was not properly addressed. The rewriter should have rewritten the loop using span access methods instead of incrementing the span itself.
