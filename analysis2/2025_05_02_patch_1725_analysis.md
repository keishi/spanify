## First error

```
../../ui/base/resource/data_pack.cc:350:27: error: no viable conversion from 'const Entry *' to 'base::span<const Entry>'
  350 |   base::span<const Entry> ret = reinterpret_cast<const Entry*>(
      |                           ^     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer returned from bsearch being assigned to a spanified variable.

## Reason
The code uses `bsearch`, which returns a `void*`. The code then casts it to `Entry*`. The spanifier attempts to change this `Entry*` into `base::span<Entry>`, but the implicit conversion fails.  The `bsearch` function returns a pointer, not a range, and `base::span` does not have a constructor that accepts a single pointer. The rewriter incorrectly assumed that a single pointer could be converted into a span.

## Solution
The rewriter should check for `bsearch` return values. The returned pointer can be converted to a span of size 1 using `base::span<Entry, 1>(reinterpret_cast<Entry*>(...))` or a single element span. Also the rewriter should check that the number of entries to construct the span is correct and available.

```c++
base::span<const Entry> ret = base::span<const Entry, 1>(reinterpret_cast<const Entry*>(
      bsearch(&resource_id, resource_table_, resource_count_, sizeof(Entry),
              Entry::CompareById)), 1);
```

## Note
The subsequent errors are all caused by the incorrect conversion to `base::span` in the first place. For example, the comparison to `nullptr` fails, as does the pointer arithmetic, and the member access using `->`. This highlights the importance of accurately handling the initial span conversion.
