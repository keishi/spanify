# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1585

## First error

```
../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `base::span::subspan()` method requires an unsigned integer as its argument. The rewriter is not casting the integer literal '5' to an unsigned type, leading to a compilation error because `strict_cast` fails.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to cast the argument to `subspan()` to `size_t` or `unsigned`. Use `base::checked_cast<size_t>` instead of `strict_cast`.

## Note
None
