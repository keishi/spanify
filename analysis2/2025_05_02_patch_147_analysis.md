## First error

../../chrome/browser/devtools/device/usb/android_usb_device.cc:58:33: error: cannot cast from type 'const std::string' (aka 'const basic_string<char>') to pointer type 'unsigned char *'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The code attempts to cast a `std::string` to an `unsigned char*` and then initialize a `base::span` with this cast. Casting a `std::string` directly to a raw pointer is not a valid conversion, as `std::string` is not guaranteed to be contiguous before C++17. The `data()` method should be used to get the underlying pointer. The rewriter made the situation worse by spanifying this code but not fixing the underlying issue.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to avoid spanifying the `x` variable because it involves a bad cast. Or alternatively the rewriter should replace `(unsigned char*)data` to `base::span<unsigned char>(reinterpret_cast<const unsigned char*>(data.data()), data.length())`.

## Note
The second error `cannot increment value of type 'base::span<unsigned char>'` is caused by the first error and is secondary. `x++` is not valid code for spans.
