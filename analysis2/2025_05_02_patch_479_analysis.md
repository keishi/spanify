# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_479

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The error occurs in the `base::numerics::safe_conversions.h` header file, specifically within the `strict_cast` function. This indicates an issue with type conversion safety when using `base::span`. The code attempts to create a subspan with a size specified as an integer, but `subspan` expects an unsigned value. The `strict_cast` is failing because it is unable to safely convert the signed integer to an unsigned integer (size_t).

## Solution
The rewriter needs to explicitly cast the argument passed to `subspan` to `size_t` (or some other unsigned integer type) using `base::checked_cast<size_t>()`. This will ensure type safety and prevent the `strict_cast` error.

The lines:
```
base::span<const unsigned char>(binary_data).subspan(0).data()),
base::span<const unsigned char>(binary_data).subspan(1).data()),
base::span<const unsigned char>(binary_data).subspan(4).data())
```
should be changed to:
```
base::span<const unsigned char>(binary_data).subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(0)).data()),
base::span<const unsigned char>(binary_data).subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(1)).data()),
base::span<const unsigned char>(binary_data).subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(4)).data())
```

The rewriter also needs to add the include directive `#include "base/numerics/safe_conversions.h"`

## Note
There are no other errors.
