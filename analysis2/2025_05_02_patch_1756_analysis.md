# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1756

## First error

missing '}' at end of definition of 'gpu::gles2::GLES2InterfaceStub'

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter is adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_stub.h`. But this header transitively includes system headers like `<algorithm>` which are wrapped with `namespace std`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition. The errors are:

```
../../third_party/libc++/src/include/__type_traits/desugars_to.h:18:1: note: still within definition of 'gpu::gles2::GLES2InterfaceStub' here
   18 | _LIBCPP_BEGIN_NAMESPACE_STD
      | ^
...
../../third_party/libc++/src/include/__ranges/access.h:44:5: error: no member named 'std' in the global namespace; did you mean simply 'std'?
   44 |   { _LIBCPP_AUTO_CAST(__t.data()) } -> __ptr_to_object;
```

## Solution
The rewriter should not add `#include "base/containers/span.h"` inside a class declaration. It should be added outside the class definition.

## Note
There are a lot of other errors caused by the same problem.
