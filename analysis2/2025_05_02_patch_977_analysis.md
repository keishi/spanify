# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_977

## First error

```
../../base/check_op.h:231:26: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('char *const' and 'const base::span<char>')
  231 | DEFINE_CHECK_OP_IMPL(LE, <=)
      | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to add .data() to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The `LastElement()` function was changed to return a `base::span<char>`, but it is being compared to a `char*`. The rewriter needs to add `.data()` to the return value of `LastElement()` at the call sites to decay the span to a pointer, in order for the code to compile.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to add `.data()` to the return value of the `LastElement()` function at the call sites.
For example:
`DCHECK_LE(position, LastElement());` should be `DCHECK_LE(position, LastElement().data());`
`if (item_iterator == list.LastElement())` should be `if (item_iterator == list.LastElement().data())`

## Note
The other errors are caused by the same root cause and will be fixed by applying the same solution.
