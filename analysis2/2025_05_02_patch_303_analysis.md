# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_303

## First error

./third_party/blink/renderer/platform/audio/sinc_resampler.cc:11906:1: error: Conflicting replacement text: ./third_party/blink/renderer/platform/audio/sinc_resampler.cc at offset 11906, length 4294967295: "=.subspan()" != "("

## Category
Overlapping replacements.

## Reason
The error message "Conflicting replacement text" indicates that there are multiple replacements trying to modify the same region of code. It appears that the rewriter is attempting to insert "=.subspan()" and "(" at the same location, leading to a conflict. This generally happens when two matchers overlap.

## Solution
Need to investigate the code around sinc_resampler.cc:11906 to figure out the cause of overlapping replacements. It is possible that the range calculation is incorrect in some cases. There could be a corner case in some macro that expands and the matchers are interfering. The fix is in general to update the matchers to handle such overlap cases.

## Note
The `data()` member call is being added to a rewritten `base::span`, but there's a conflict. It is possible that some rewrite in `ArrayDataViewImpl` in `mojo/public/cpp/bindings/array_data_view.h` is causing the issue.
