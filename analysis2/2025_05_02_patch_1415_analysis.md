# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1415

## First error
../../url/url_canon_ip.cc:41:7: error: no matching function for call to 'AppendIPv4Address'
   41 |       AppendIPv4Address(host_info->address, output);

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `AppendIPv4Address` was spanified, but the call site in `DoCanonicalizeIPv4Address` passes a raw pointer (`host_info->address`) without creating a span. The compiler error indicates that there is no matching function because the argument type does not match the expected `base::span<const unsigned char, 4>`. This means the rewriter spanified the function definition, but failed to update this particular call site to pass a proper span.

## Solution
The rewriter must ensure that all call sites to spanified functions are also updated to pass the correct span type, potentially by constructing a `base::span` from the raw pointer and size information if available. In this case, the rewriter should create a span from `host_info->address` with size `4`.

## Note
The change to `net/cert/x509_certificate.cc` looks correct.
