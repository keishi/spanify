## First error

```
../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan()` method requires an unsigned integer as its argument. In the original code, `frames_per_block` is an integer, but subspan is expecting an unsigned value. The compiler is complaining that it can't find a suitable `strict_cast` to convert the signed integer `frames_per_block` to an unsigned integer for the `subspan` call.

## Solution
The rewriter should cast the `frames_per_block` argument to `subspan` to an unsigned type, such as `size_t` using `base::checked_cast`.

## Note
The second error is `cannot increment value of type 'base::span<const float>'`.
Since span is not a pointer, it cannot be incremented. The rewriter should rewrite `*slide_out * *slide_out` to `slide_out[0] * slide_out[0]` and remove `++slide_in` and `++slide_out` increments.
