# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_864

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan()` method requires an unsigned integer as an argument. The `index` variable in `Schema::InternalStorage::properties(int index)` is a signed integer.  The rewriter did not insert a cast to `size_t` or `unsigned int` when calling `subspan(index)`, leading to a compilation error because `strict_cast` does not allow implicit conversion from signed to unsigned when the full range of the signed value cannot be represented in the unsigned type.

## Solution
The rewriter should insert a cast to `size_t` or `unsigned int` when a signed integer is used as an argument to `subspan()`.

```c++
// Original code:
return schema_data_.properties_nodes.subspan(index).data();

// Rewritten code:
return schema_data_.properties_nodes.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(index)).data();
```

## Note
The fix is to explicitly cast `index` to `size_t` to ensure that the argument passed to `subspan()` is an unsigned integer.
