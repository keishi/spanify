# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1103

## First error

../../components/image_fetcher/core/image_fetcher_metrics_reporter.cc:76:3: error: no matching function for call to 'FactoryGet'

## Category
Rewriter needs to add .data() to `char[]` converted to std::array passed to `base::StringPrintf`.

## Reason
The code is passing a `std::array<char, 20>` to `UMA_HISTOGRAM_ENUMERATION` which uses `base::LinearHistogram::FactoryGet`.
`base::LinearHistogram::FactoryGet` expects a `std::string_view`, `std::string` or `const char*` as its first argument, but it's receiving a `std::array<char, 20>`.
The rewriter converted `kEventsHistogram` from `char[]` to `std::array<char, 20>`, but it didn't add `.data()` when it's used with `base::LinearHistogram::FactoryGet`.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize when a `std::array<char, N>` (converted from `char[N]`) is passed to a function like `base::LinearHistogram::FactoryGet` and automatically add `.data()` to it.
