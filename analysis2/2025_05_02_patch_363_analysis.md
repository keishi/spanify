# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_363

## First error

Overlapping replacements: ./base/atomicops.cc at offset 1922, length 4294967295: "=src_byte_ptr.subspan()" and offset 2129, length 1: " "

## Category
Overlapping replacements between EraseMemberCall and EraseMemberCall.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to both erase a member call (likely related to `subspan`) and make another replacement in the same area, leading to overlapping replacements. This can occur when the rewriter attempts to apply multiple rewrites to the same section of code. The first replacement is the `=src_byte_ptr.subspan()` on this line
`base::span<const uint8_t>src_byte_ptr = src;`
while the second replacement is the removal of the space at
`.store( src_byte_ptr[0], std::memory_order_relaxed);`

## Solution
The rewriter logic needs to be adjusted to avoid overlapping replacements. This might involve prioritizing certain replacements over others or adjusting the replacement ranges to prevent conflicts. The rewriter should check for existing replacements in a given range before attempting to add a new one.

## Note
The overlapping replacements prevent the code from compiling.
