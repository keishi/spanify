## First error

../../chrome/browser/ui/views/webid/account_selection_bubble_view_unittest.cc:193:9: error: no viable conversion from 'const std::array<char, 7>' to 'const std::string' (aka 'const basic_string<char>')
  193 |         kAccountSuffix, idp_data_, login_state);
      |         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to add .data() to arrayified `char[]` variable used with std::string.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `kAccountSuffix` from `char[]` to `std::array<char, 7>`, but the code was concatenating it with a `std::string`.  The `std::string` constructor and `operator+` don't accept `std::array` directly, but they do accept C-style strings (char pointers). The fix is to call `.data()` on the array to get a `const char*`.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize when a `char[]` converted to `std::array` is being used in a context where a `const char*` is expected (such as constructing a `std::string` or concatenating to a `std::string`) and add `.data()` to the variable.

## Category
Rewriter needs to add .data() to arrayified `char[]` variable used with std::string.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `kAccountSuffix` from `char[]` to `std::array<char, 7>`, but the code was passing this variable as an argument to `CreateTestIdentityRequestAccount`, which is defined in `chrome/browser/ui/views/webid/account_selection_view_test_base.h`. The function expects a `const std::string&` for the `account_suffix` argument.  `std::string` has no constructor that accepts a `std::array` directly.  The fix is to call `.data()` on the array to get a `const char*`.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize when a `char[]` converted to `std::array` is being used in a context where a `const char*` or `const std::string&` is expected and add `.data()` to the variable.
