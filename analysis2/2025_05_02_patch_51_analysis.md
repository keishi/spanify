## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan` method requires an unsigned value as its argument. In this case, the code `source = source.subspan(4);` passes a literal `4` which is implicitly an `int`. Because `int` cannot be safely converted to `size_t`, which is required by `subspan`, the compiler throws an error.

## Solution
The rewriter should cast the argument to `subspan` to an unsigned type (e.g., `size_t` or `unsigned int`). It could either add the `u` suffix to the literal or use `base::checked_cast<size_t>(...)` to explicitly cast the value.
For example, `source = source.subspan(4u);` or `source = source.subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(4));`

## Note
The build log contains additional errors:

*   The functions `simd::PackOneRowOfRGBA8LittleToR8`, `simd::PackOneRowOfRGBA8LittleToRA8`, and `simd::PackOneRowOfRGBA8LittleToRGBA8` expect `const uint8_t*& source` as arguments, but after spanification, `source` becomes `base::span<const uint8_t>`.  The rewriter should have also updated the signatures of these functions to accept `base::span<const uint8_t>`.
*   The rewriter uses `static_cast<const SrcType*>(source_data)` to cast `base::span<const uint8_t>` to pointer types. Instead of casting to raw pointer, the rewriter should use `.data()` to access the underlying data of the `base::span`, then cast to the pointer type.

```cpp
-      const SrcType* src_row_start = static_cast<const SrcType*>(source_data);
+      base::span<const SrcType> src_row_start = base::span<const SrcType>(static_cast<const SrcType*>(source_data.data()), source_data.size());
