# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1414

## First error
../../net/base/ip_address.h:147:12: error: no matching function for call to 'IPv6AddressToNumber'

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `url::IPv6AddressToNumber` was spanified, but the call site in `net/base/ip_address.h` was not updated to pass a span. The `bytes->data()` call returns a raw pointer, but the function now expects a `base::span<unsigned char, 16>`. The fix will require either spanifying `bytes` or creating a temporary span from `bytes->data()`.

## Solution
Spanify the `bytes` variable in `ParseIPLiteralToBytes` function.

```c++
constexpr bool ParseIPLiteralToBytes(std::string_view ip_literal,
                                     IPAddress* bytes) {
  // Try parsing the hostname as an IPv6 literal.
  base::span<unsigned char, 16> ipv6_bytes = bytes->bytes();
  return url::IPv6AddressToNumber(host_with_brackets.data(), host_comp,
                                  ipv6_bytes);
}
```

## Note
The diff introduces a new `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in `url/url_canon_ip.h`, which is not needed because this file already includes `<url/url_canon.h>` and this header transitively includes `base/containers/span.h`. The diff should remove that include.
