## First error

../../chrome/browser/autocomplete/search_provider_unittest.cc:1589:16: error: no matching function for call to 'to_array'

## Category
Rewriter doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The code is using `std::to_array` with an initializer list. The rewriter likely intended to convert a C-style array to `std::array` but introduced an incompatibility with `std::to_array`. The `std::to_array` function expects an actual array as input, not an initializer list. This pattern is similar to assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end since the initializer list gets converted to array before it is passed to `std::to_array`, so it is the same root cause.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid using `std::to_array` with initializer lists directly. If the intention is to create a `std::array` from an initializer list, a direct initialization should be used instead. Rewriter can change the `std::to_array` to `std::array` and it will work.
