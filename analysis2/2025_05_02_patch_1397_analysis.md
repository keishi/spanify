## Category
Rewriter doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The code attempts to assign the result of `std::begin` to a `base::span`. `std::begin` returns a pointer, but the span constructor used here expects a range, so the implicit conversion fails.

## Solution
The rewriter is not able to rewrite assignment from `std::begin` and `std::end` yet. We need to update the spanification to properly rewrite the variable assignment.
