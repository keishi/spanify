# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_529

## First error
../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `ConcatV2Args2` function uses `arg0_shape.subspan(axis)` and `arg1_shape.subspan(axis)`. The `subspan()` method requires an unsigned integer as its argument. However, the `axis` variable is a signed integer (`int32_t`). The compiler fails to find a suitable `strict_cast` to convert the signed `axis` to an unsigned type.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to wrap the `axis` variable with `base::checked_cast<size_t>()` when calling `subspan()`. This will ensure that the argument is an unsigned integer and that the conversion is safe.

For example, the following code:
```c++
arg0_shape.subspan(axis)
```

should be rewritten to:
```c++
arg0_shape.subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(axis))
```

Additionally, include the `base/numerics/safe_conversions.h` header in the file if it's not already included.

## Note
The other errors are caused by the same underlying issue where `ShapeSize` is called with `const int32_t*` instead of `base::span<const int32_t>`.
