## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The code was rewritten to use `output_values.subspan(...)`, but then the rewriter tried to use `.data()` on the return value of `subspan`. `subspan()` returns a `base::span`, which does not have a `data()` method. Furthermore, the code was trying to call `.data()` on an integer. The error indicates that the rewriter incorrectly assumed the result of subspan was a type that requires or allows `.data()`, and also failed to correctly track the type after the subspan operation. The goal was to get the underlying pointer, but the rewriter should have assigned the subspan to a pointer.

## Solution
The rewriter should not add `.data()` when it is not necessary. In this case the rewriter should have assigned the `subspan()` return value to a pointer.
```c++
T* out = output_values.subspan(
            (((out_batch * output_height + out_h) * output_width + out_w) *
                 output_depth +
             0));
