# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1042

## First error

../../services/network/tls_client_socket_unittest.cc:581:17: error: no matching function for call to 'byte_span_from_cstring'

## Category
Rewriter failed to add .data() to `char[]` converted to std::array passed to `base::StringPrintf`.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `kSecretMsg` from a `char[]` to a `std::string_view`. However, the `base::byte_span_from_cstring` function expects a null-terminated C-style string (`const char (&str LIFETIME_BOUND)[Extent]`).  Because `kSecretMsg` is now a `std::string_view`, the compiler cannot find a matching function overload. The correct approach would be to call `kSecretMsg.data()` to get a `const char*` and then pass it to `byte_span_from_cstring`. It looks like the rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a variable it did not spanify, because the `.data()` should be added to `kSecretMsg`, not `kSecretMsgSize`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to identify when a converted `char[]` (now a `std::string_view`) is passed to `base::byte_span_from_cstring` and automatically add `.data()` to the argument. The rewriter should be checking for the type of the argument to the function call.

Example:

```c++
//Original
base::byte_span_from_cstring(kSecretMsg)

//Rewritten
base::byte_span_from_cstring(kSecretMsg.data())
```

## Note
The same error occurs multiple times in the file.
