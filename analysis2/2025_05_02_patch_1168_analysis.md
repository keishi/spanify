# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1168

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/xr/xr_session.cc:966:45: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') and 'String')

## Category
Rewriter needs to handle `std::string_view` + `String` concatenation in third party code.

## Reason
The code attempts to concatenate a `std::string_view` with a `String` object. This operation is not directly supported. `kFeatureNotSupportedBySessionPrefix` was rewritten to be a `std::string_view`, but the `XRSessionFeatureToString` returns a `String`, and there's no `operator+` defined between the two.

## Solution
The rewriter should insert `.ToString()` on the `std::string_view` to make it compatible with the `String` type when string concatenation is performed.
```
(kFeatureNotSupportedBySessionPrefix.ToString() +
            XRSessionFeatureToString(
                device::mojom::XRSessionFeature::HIT_TEST));
```
This converts the string_view to String before concatenation.

## Note
This issue appears multiple times in the build log, on lines 1066, 1436 and 2012.
