## First error

../../storage/common/file_system/file_system_util.cc:35:24: error: redefinition of 'kExternalDir' with a different type: 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') vs 'const char[]'

## Category
Rewriter dropped mutable qualifier.

## Reason
The original code declares `kExternalDir` in `storage/common/file_system/file_system_util.h` as `extern const char kExternalDir[];`. The rewriter changed this to `const std::string_view kExternalDir = "/external";` in `storage/common/file_system/file_system_util.cc`. However, the two declarations are incompatible. This is a redefinition error because the type of `kExternalDir` is changed from `const char[]` to `const std::string_view`, causing a conflict.

## Solution
The rewriter should not change the type of a variable defined in a header. Instead, it should only rewrite the variable where it is used. The rewriter can achieve this by generating replacements only where `kExternalDir` is used, instead of changing its definition. The current approach is trying to rewrite the variable definition which leads to the redefinition error.

## Note
The second error is "no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'const char[]' to 'base::span<const char>'". This error occurs because the rewriter also tries to create `base::span` from `kExternalDir`, which is no longer a `const char[]`.
