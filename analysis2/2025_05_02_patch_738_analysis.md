# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_738

## First error

```
../../gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h:2259:42: error: no viable conversion from 'const volatile GLenum *' (aka 'const volatile unsigned int *') to 'base::span<const volatile GLenum>' (aka 'span<const volatile unsigned int>')
 2259 |   DoInvalidateFramebuffer(target, count, attachments);
      |                                          ^~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The function `DoInvalidateFramebuffer` in `gles2_cmd_decoder.cc` was spanified. However, this function is called by `DoInvalidateFramebuffer` in `gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h`. The `gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h` file is generated code, and should be excluded from spanification. The rewriter spanified a function that required rewriting excluded code.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid spanifying `DoInvalidateFramebuffer` in `gles2_cmd_decoder.cc` because it is called by auto-generated code in `gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h`.

## Note
The other two errors are the same, related to other calls to `DoInvalidateSubFramebuffer` and `DoDiscardFramebufferEXT` inside the autogenerated header.
