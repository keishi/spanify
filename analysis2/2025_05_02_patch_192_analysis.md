## First error

../../storage/common/file_system/file_system_util.cc:36:24: error: redefinition of 'kTestDir' with a different type: 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') vs 'const char[]'
   36 | const std::string_view kTestDir = "/test";
      |                        ^
../../storage/common/file_system/file_system_util.h:27:52: note: previous declaration is here
   27 | COMPONENT_EXPORT(STORAGE_COMMON) extern const char kTestDir[];
      |                                                    ^

## Category
Rewriter introduced a conflicting redefinition of an exported constant.

## Reason
The rewriter changed `kTestDir`'s type from `const char[]` (declared in the header file) to `const std::string_view` in the `.cc` file.  The original declaration in `file_system_util.h` used `extern const char kTestDir[]`. This means that `kTestDir` is defined elsewhere in the code (likely in the `.cc` file). By redefining it as `const std::string_view kTestDir`, the compiler throws a redefinition error.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid changing the type of variables that are declared `extern` in header files, as that changes the ABI for anything depending on the header file. If the goal is to convert the variable to `std::string_view`, that change needs to be reflected in the header file.

## Note
The second error is caused by the conversion from `const char kTestDir[]` to `base::span<const char>`. This error is caused by trying to implicitly cast a const char array to a `base::span`. This can be solved by using `base::make_span`.
