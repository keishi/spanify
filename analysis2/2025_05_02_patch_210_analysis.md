## First error

../../remoting/host/linux/remoting_user_session.cc:268:24: error: no viable conversion from 'char *' to 'base::span<char>'
  268 |       base::span<char> delimiter = std::strchr(*variable, '=');
      |                        ^           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying return value from `std::strchr`.

## Reason
The code attempts to assign the result of `std::strchr` (which returns a `char*`) to a `base::span<char>`. There is no implicit conversion from a raw pointer to a span. The rewriter incorrectly assumed that the return value of `std::strchr` could be automatically converted to a span. The error message "no viable conversion from 'char *' to 'base::span<char>'" clearly indicates this. `std::strchr` is a system function that the rewriter shouldn't be spanifying because it cannot determine the size of the resulting buffer.

## Solution
The rewriter should not attempt to rewrite the return value of `std::strchr` to a `base::span<char>`. It should recognize that `std::strchr` is a system function and avoid spanifying its return value. The returned variable should be a raw pointer `char*` instead.

## Note
The code then attempts to use span operations on a pointer, which will also fail. This can be fixed by not spanifying `delimiter`.
