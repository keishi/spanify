# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1848

## First error

../../base/debug/elf_reader.cc:89:20: error: no viable overloaded '='
   89 |       current_note = reinterpret_cast<const Nhdr*>(current_section);

## Category
Rewriter does not handle assignment of spanified variable from a raw pointer.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `current_note` to a `base::span<const Nhdr>`, but it didn't properly handle the assignment from a raw pointer (`reinterpret_cast<const Nhdr*>(current_section)`). A `base::span` cannot be directly assigned a raw pointer; it needs to be constructed with a size (or default constructed to represent an empty span).

## Solution
The rewriter should generate code to construct the `base::span` from the raw pointer, implying that a size must be known or an empty span is desired. Since the size is unknown in this case, initialize with `{}`.

```c++
base::span<const Nhdr> current_note = {};
```
```c++
base::span<const Nhdr> current_note = {reinterpret_cast<const Nhdr*>(current_section), 1};
```

## Note
Multiple errors are present due to the first error. The fix suggested should solve the other errors. Specifically, the reinterpret cast error, and the member reference type errors.
