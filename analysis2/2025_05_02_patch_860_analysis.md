# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_860

## First error

```
Overlapping replacements: ./components/feedback/redaction_tool/ip_address.h at offset 2045, length 8: "" and offset 2047, length 0: "*"
```

## Category
Overlapping replacements between EraseMemberCall and EraseMemberCall.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to apply conflicting replacements to the same region of code. This occurs because it seems to be trying to both rewrite `begin()` to return a `base::span` while also adding `.data()` to it.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to avoid generating conflicting replacements. It should prioritize generating the correct code for both return value and usage.

## Note
The overlapping replacement happens in `ip_address.h`.
```c++
   const base::span<uint8_t> begin() const { return *data(); }
```
The replacements are:
```
r 0002045:r4w-Y7Hk r:::./components/feedback/redaction_tool/ip_address.h:::2045:::8:::base::span
r 0002047:r4w-Y7Hk r:::./components/feedback/redaction_tool/ip_address.h:::2047:::0:::*
