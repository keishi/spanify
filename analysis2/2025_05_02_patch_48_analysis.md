# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_48

## First error

../../media/gpu/test/video_encoder/video_encoder_test_environment.cc:82:34: error: no matching function for call to 'to_array'

## Category
Rewriter does not handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `double bitrate[2][3]` to `std::array<std::array<double, 3>, 2> bitrate`, but failed to rewrite `std::to_array<BitrateTable>({ ... })`. `std::to_array` requires the argument to be a C-style array, not an initializer list.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to recognize the usage of `std::to_array` with an initializer list and rewrite it to construct the `std::array` directly. There's no good way to do that today because it will require size calculation and potentially brace elision.

## Note
N/A
