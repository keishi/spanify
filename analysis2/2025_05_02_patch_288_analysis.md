# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_288

## First error

../../mojo/public/cpp/bindings/lib/validation_util.h:40:11: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<const uint64_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned long>') to 'uintptr_t' (aka 'unsigned long') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter replaced `const uint64_t* offset` with `base::span<const uint64_t> offset`. However, the code still uses `reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(offset)` which is not allowed on a span. The rewriter should have removed the `reinterpret_cast`.

## Solution
The rewriter should detect the `reinterpret_cast` and generate code that avoids it, perhaps by accessing the underlying pointer using `offset.data()` and casting that. Alternatively, the `offset` could have been left as a pointer.
