## First error

```
../../ui/base/resource/data_pack.cc:267:16: error: no viable overloaded '='
  267 |   alias_table_ = reinterpret_cast<const Alias*>(
      |   ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  268 |       &data[margin_to_skip + resource_table_size]);
      |       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter does not handle assignment of spanified variable from an allocation using new.

## Reason
The code is attempting to assign a raw pointer to a `base::raw_span`. The `alias_table_` member was converted to `base::raw_span<const Alias, AllowPtrArithmetic> alias_table_;`. The assignment `alias_table_ = reinterpret_cast<const Alias*>(...)` is invalid because it's trying to assign a raw pointer to a span. The span needs a size, which is not being provided in this assignment.

## Solution
The rewriter should create a span when assigning from a raw pointer with the size.
```
alias_table_ = base::make_span(reinterpret_cast<const Alias*>(&data[margin_to_skip + resource_table_size]), alias_count_);
```

## Note
The rewriter failed to properly handle the assignment to the span after converting `alias_table_` to a `base::raw_span`.
