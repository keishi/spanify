## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The rewriter generated a call to `b_src.subspan(s).data()` where `s` is an integer. However, the `subspan` method requires an unsigned integer. The `strict_cast` function is used internally by `subspan` to enforce the type safety of the conversion from signed to unsigned, but the compiler could not find a viable candidate template because the static range relation was not `kContained`.

## Solution
The rewriter should wrap the argument `s` to `subspan` with `base::checked_cast<size_t>` to ensure it is a `size_t` (unsigned) and prevent this error. The rewriter should also add `#include "base/numerics/safe_conversions.h"`.

The corrected code would be:
```c++
m_sum =
    _mm_add_ps(m_sum, _mm_mul_ps(_mm_loadu_ps(a_src + s),
                                 _mm_loadu_ps(b_src.subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(s)).data())));
