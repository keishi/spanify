## First error

../../chrome/browser/support_tool/screenshot_data_collector.cc:105:29: error: no viable conversion from 'webrtc::DesktopFrame' to 'base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The code attempts to assign the result of `*frame` (which is a `webrtc::DesktopFrame`) to a `base::span<const uint8_t>`. However, there's no implicit conversion from `webrtc::DesktopFrame` to `base::span<const uint8_t>`. The rewriter should have generated code to construct a `base::span` from the `DesktopFrame` object.  The error message indicates that none of the `base::span` constructors are viable for the given input type.

## Solution
The rewriter should generate code to construct a `base::span` from the `webrtc::DesktopFrame` object using the `frame->data()` and a size parameter.

The rewriter should generate:

```c++
base::span<const uint8_t> frame_buffer = base::span<const uint8_t>(frame->data(), frame->size().width() * frame->size().height() * 4);
```

or maybe just

```c++
base::span<const uint8_t> frame_buffer = base::make_span(frame->data(), frame->size().width() * frame->size().height() * 4);
```

However, there is a more fundamental problem here. `webrtc::DesktopFrame` does not necessarily own its underlying buffer. This means that the resulting span is not valid when the `webrtc::DesktopFrame` object is destroyed. Therefore the span returned by `webrtc::DesktopFrame` should only be used for the life time of that object. The rewriter can't fix that.

## Note
The second error shows that the rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value, which is a separate issue.
