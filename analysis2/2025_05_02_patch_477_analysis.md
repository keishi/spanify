## First error

```
../../ui/snapshot/snapshot_aura_unittest.cc:81:24: error: no viable conversion from 'uint32_t *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<uint32_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned int>')
   81 |   base::span<uint32_t> bitmap_data =
      |                        ^
   82 |       reinterpret_cast<uint32_t*>(bitmap->pixelRef()->pixels());
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The code attempts to assign the result of `bitmap->pixelRef()->pixels()` to a `base::span<uint32_t>`. `bitmap->pixelRef()->pixels()` returns a raw `uint32_t*` pointer, and there's no implicit conversion from a raw pointer to `base::span`. The `base::span` needs to be constructed explicitly with the pointer and a size. The rewriter should have recognized this pattern and generated the appropriate span construction code.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to wrap the raw pointer with a `base::span` constructor, and figure out the size of the data. In this case, since the data comes from the bitmap itself, it could use `bitmap->width() * bitmap->height()` to determine the size. The corrected code should look like this:

```c++
base::span<uint32_t> bitmap_data(
    reinterpret_cast<uint32_t*>(bitmap->pixelRef()->pixels()),
    bitmap->width() * bitmap->height());
```
## Note
The rewriter needs to be able to get the width and height from the `SkBitmap` object.
