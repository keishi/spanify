# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1011

## First error

../../media/base/vector_math.cc:114:5: error: return type 'void (*)(const float *, int, float *)' must match previous return type 'void (*)(base::span<const float>, int, float *)' when lambda expression has unspecified explicit return type

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `FCLAMP_AVX` was spanified, but the rewriter failed to spanify the lambda in `CpuFeatures::FClamp`.  As a result, the return type of the lambda is `void (*)(const float *, int, float *)`, but the return type of the function is `void (*)(base::span<const float>, int, float *)`.  This is a type mismatch.

## Solution
The rewriter should spanify the lambda in `CpuFeatures::FClamp` to match the signature of `FCLAMP_AVX`.

## Note
The second error is "reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<const float>' to 'uintptr_t' (aka 'unsigned long') is not allowed".  The rewriter should not have allowed the reinterpret cast.  The third error is "no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'".  This is a duplicate of category "Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value."
