# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1389

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:523:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'

## Category
Rewriter doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The code attempts to initialize a `base::span` using `std::begin` on a C-style array `kShortcutNotUniqueTestProviders`. The `std::begin` function returns a raw pointer (`policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *`), and there's no implicit conversion from a raw pointer to `base::span<policy::TestProvider>`. The rewriter should have recognized this pattern and handled it.

## Solution
The rewriter should be updated to correctly handle the assignment of spanified variables when `std::begin` and `std::end` are used. The correct usage is to either construct the span directly from the array like `base::span(kShortcutNotUniqueTestProviders)` or to construct the span from the iterators like `base::span(std::begin(kShortcutNotUniqueTestProviders), std::end(kShortcutNotUniqueTestProviders))`.

The general idea would be to rewrite:
```c++
base::span<T> span_var = std::begin(array);
```
to
```c++
base::span<T> span_var(std::begin(array), std::end(array));
```
The same logic should be applied when `span_var` is initialized using assignment operator with an existing span variable.

## Note
The second error `../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:525:57: error: cannot increment value of type 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'` stems from the same issue. The rewriter transformed the iterator variable to span and did not update the ++ operator. Also the == operator is not implemented because `policy::TestProvider` does not support it.
