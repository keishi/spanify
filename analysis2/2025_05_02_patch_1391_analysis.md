# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1391

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:580:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'

## Category
Rewriter doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The rewriter changed the loop iterator `it` to a `base::span<policy::TestProvider>`, but `std::begin(kEmptyFieldTestProviders)` returns a pointer (`policy::TestProvider *`).  There's no implicit conversion from a raw pointer to a `base::span` in this context.  The `base::span` constructors that take ranges or iterators are not being matched correctly. Also span does not overload `!=` operator with `*`

## Solution
The rewriter needs to correctly handle assignments from `std::begin` and `std::end` to spanified variables. This may involve explicitly constructing a `base::span` from the pointer returned by `std::begin` and using the size. The correct loop would be:
```c++
for (base::span<policy::TestProvider> it(kEmptyFieldTestProviders, std::size(kEmptyFieldTestProviders));
       it != std::end(kEmptyFieldTestProviders); ++it) {
    policy_value.Append(GenerateSiteSearchPolicyEntry(it[0]));
  }
```
The rewriter should also rewrite the `!=` to compare the pointer of span.

## Note
The other errors stem from the first error.
