# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1673

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_stub.h:14:7: error: missing '}' at end of definition of 'gpu::gles2::GLES2InterfaceStub'

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter is adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_stub.h`. But this header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition. The class is not properly terminated because of this.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in header files. Or alternatively it should avoid including system headers inside a C++ class declaration.

## Note
The errors like `no member named 'std' in the global namespace` are due to the missing `}`.
