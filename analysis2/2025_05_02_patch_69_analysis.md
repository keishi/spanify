# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_69

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/fonts/skia/skia_text_metrics.cc:32:42: error: member reference base type 'const uint8_t *' (aka 'const unsigned char *') is not a structure or union
   32 |       reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(p).subspan(byte_size).data());
      |       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The code first casts a `base::span<const T>` to `const uint8_t*`, and then attempts to call `.subspan()` on the result of the cast. Since `subspan()` is a member function of the `base::span` class, it cannot be called directly on a raw pointer. The rewriter should have removed the reinterpret_cast when it spanified the code.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid spanifying a variable that has a reinterpret_cast applied to it.

## Note
There's a second error, `reinterpret_cast from 'const unsigned int *' to 'uint8_t *' (aka 'unsigned char *') casts away qualifiers`. This error was likely there before and was exposed because of this patch. The rewriter is introducing new errors by rewriting incorrect code.
