# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_858

## First error

```
../../components/feedback/redaction_tool/ip_address.h:61:51: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'const std::array<uint8_t, 16>' (aka 'const array<unsigned char, 16>') to function return type 'const base::span<uint8_t>' (aka 'const span<unsigned char>')
   61 |   const base::span<uint8_t> data() const { return bytes_; }
      |                                                   ^~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter failed to handle cast of single variable span.

## Reason
The rewriter changed `bytes_` from `std::array<uint8_t, 16>` to `base::span<uint8_t>` as a return value, but failed to update the return statement from `std::array<uint8_t, 16>` to `base::span<uint8_t>`. There is no implicit conversion from `std::array<uint8_t, 16>` to `base::span<uint8_t>`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to add conversion for single variable span return.

## Note
Other errors were also present:
* Incompatible return type for begin()
* Incompatible argument type for AppendIPv4Address
* Incompatible argument type for AppendIPv6Address
* Incompatible argument type for IPAddressPrefixCheck
