# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1565

## First error

```
../../components/compose/core/browser/compose_metrics.cc:38:24: error: redefinition of 'kComposeSessionUndoCount' with a different type: 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') vs 'const char[]'
   38 | const std::string_view kComposeSessionUndoCount = "Compose.Session.UndoCount";
      |                        ^
```

## Category
Rewriter introduced a redefinition error by changing the type of a variable declared as `extern const char[]` in the header file to `const std::string_view` in the source file.

## Reason
The variable `kComposeSessionUndoCount` is declared as `extern const char kComposeSessionUndoCount[];` in `compose_metrics.h`. This declaration indicates that the variable is defined elsewhere as a C-style string (character array). The rewriter incorrectly changed the definition in `compose_metrics.cc` to `const std::string_view kComposeSessionUndoCount = "Compose.Session.UndoCount";`. This creates a redefinition error because the type of the variable in the source file no longer matches the type specified in the header file.

## Solution
The rewriter should not change the type of variables that are declared as `extern const char[]` in header files. The definition in the source file must match the declaration in the header file. Remove the change and keep the original definition:
```c++
const char kComposeSessionUndoCount[] = "Compose.Session.UndoCount";
```

## Note
The second error is a consequence of the first one and will be resolved when the first error is fixed.
