# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1450

## First error

Overlapping replacements: ./services/data_decoder/image_decoder_impl_unittest.cc at offset 5964, length 19: "(kRandomData.size() * sizeof(decltype(kRandomData)::value_type))" and offset 5970, length 0: ".data()"

## Category
Overlapping replacements between RewriteArraySizeof and AppendDataCall.

## Reason
The rewriter attempts to apply two conflicting replacements to the same region of code. First, it tries to replace `sizeof(kRandomData)` with `(kRandomData.size() * sizeof(decltype(kRandomData)::value_type))`. Second, it tries to add `.data()` to `kRandomData`. These replacements overlap because the `.data()` addition is being added within the region that `RewriteArraySizeof` is modifying.

## Solution
The rewriter logic needs to be adjusted to avoid overlapping replacements. In this specific case, the rewriter needs to determine whether a `.data()` call is required *before* applying the `RewriteArraySizeof` replacement. If it is, the `.data()` call should be added to the base expression *before* calculating the size. One way to fix this might be to generate an intermediate variable that the .data() call can be performed on.

## Note
The diff also adds `<string_view>`, but this appears to be a correct change. The core issue is the overlapping replacements.
