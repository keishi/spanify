# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_777

## First error

```
../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/audio/vector_math_test.cc:387:21: error: no viable conversion from 'const base::span<float>' to 'const float *'
  387 |   for (const float* source_base :
      |                     ^           ~
```

## Category
Rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the return type of `GetSource()` from `const float*` to `base::span<float>`. However, the code iterates through `GetPrimaryVectors()` which calls `GetSource()`, and the loop variable is declared as `const float*`. The rewriter failed to add `.data()` to decay the `base::span<float>` into a `const float*`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to add `.data()` to the return value of `GetSource()` in the loops where the loop variable type is `const float*`.

Change lines 387 and 481 from:

```c++
for (const float* source_base :
```

to:

```c++
for (const float* source_base : GetPrimaryVectors(GetSource(kFullyNonNanSource).data()))
```

The fix is to add .data() to this call site.
## Note
This problem appears in two places in the code, so the fix needs to be applied in both locations.
