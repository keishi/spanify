## First error

```
../../net/disk_cache/blockfile/entry_impl.cc:212:20: error: no viable conversion from 'IOBuffer' (aka 'net::IOBuffer') to 'base::span<char>'
  212 |   base::span<char> buffer = *buf;
      |                    ^        ~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to perform a `.data()` when converting an IOBuffer to a span.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to convert `*buf` (an `IOBuffer` object) directly to a `base::span<char>`. `IOBuffer` does not implicitly convert to `base::span<char>`. The correct way to obtain a `base::span<char>` from an `IOBuffer` is to use the `data()` method to get a `char*` and then construct a span using the pointer and length.

## Solution
The rewriter should be updated to generate code that uses `.data()` when converting an `IOBuffer` to a `base::span`. The correct code should be:

```c++
base::span<char> buffer(buf->data(), len);
```

## Note
The second error occurs due to the use of `subspan()` without a cast to `size_t`. The first error needs to be addressed first.
