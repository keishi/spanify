# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1741

## First error

../../components/gcm_driver/crypto/gcm_encryption_provider_unittest.cc:647:46: error: no viable conversion from 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') to 'const std::string' (aka 'const basic_string<char>')

## Category
Rewriter failed to handle replacing string constants with string_view.

## Reason
The rewriter replaced `const char[]` with `std::string_view`. However, there were call sites that expected a `const std::string&`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate an implicit conversion from `std::string_view` to `std::string`. The generated code should be equivalent to calling `std::string{string_view_variable}`.
