## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan` method requires an unsigned integer as an argument, but the code is passing a signed integer. The `strict_cast` function is used to ensure that the value is within the valid range for the destination type. The compiler couldn't find a matching function for `strict_cast` because the source and destination types are incompatible in terms of their signedness.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to cast the argument to `subspan` to an unsigned value to ensure compatibility with the method signature. This can be done by using `base::checked_cast<size_t>` to safely convert the value to `size_t`.

## Note
There are additional errors later in the log related to `AppendData` and `TestSuccessNonrangeRequest` not accepting `std::string_view`. These are secondary errors that stem from the `kTestData1` constant being converted to `std::string_view`.
