## First error

../../media/gpu/vaapi/av1_vaapi_video_encoder_delegate.cc:262:18: error: cannot increment value of type 'base::span<uint8_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned char>')
  262 |       dst_seg_map++;
      |       ~~~~~~~~~~~^

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using increment operator on spanified variable.

## Reason
The code attempts to increment `dst_seg_map`, which is now a `base::span<uint8_t>`. The increment operator is not defined for `base::span`, as spans are not meant to be directly manipulated as pointers. The original code likely used `dst_seg_map` as a pointer to write to memory, but after spanification, the rewriter didn't replace the pointer arithmetic with appropriate span operations like using `dst_seg_map[index]` to access individual elements or `.subspan()` to advance the span.

## Solution
The rewriter should replace pointer increments on spanified variables with appropriate span operations. In this case, it should use indexing to assign values to the span.  Introduce a loop counter or index to access the elements of the span instead of incrementing the span itself.

```c++
for (size_t i = 0; i < dst_seg_size * coded_size.height(); ++i) {
      uint8_t most_freq = 0;
      uint32_t counts[kMaxSegments] = {};
      for (uint32_t y = 0; y < src_seg_size; ++y) {
        for (uint32_t x = 0; x < src_seg_size; ++x) {
          uint32_t j = (row + y) * coded_size.width() + col + x;
          uint8_t seg_idx = src_seg_map[j];
          counts[seg_idx]++;
        }
      }
      for (size_t i = 1; i < num_segments; ++i) {
        if (counts[i] > counts[most_freq]) {
          most_freq = i;
        }
      }
      dst_seg_map[i] = most_freq;
    }
```

## Note
The function parameters have been converted to `base::span`, however the code is not correctly updated to work with span.
