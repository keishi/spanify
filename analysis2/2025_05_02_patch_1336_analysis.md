## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan` method requires an unsigned integer type for its arguments, but the code is passing a signed integer (`y * size.width()`). This causes a compilation error because `strict_cast` in `base::numerics::safe_conversions.h` cannot convert from `int` to `size_t` in this context.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to cast the argument to `subspan` to `size_t` to ensure type compatibility. The change should be to wrap `y * size.width()` in `base::checked_cast<size_t>()`.

Example:
```c++
y_plane_data.subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(y * size.width())).data()
```

The rewriter should also add the necessary `#include` directives for `base/numerics/safe_conversions.h` and `cstdint` if they are not already included.

## Note
The other errors are follow-up errors due to the first error not being resolved. They all stem from `CreateFrame` expecting a `base::span<const uint8_t>` but receiving a raw pointer.
