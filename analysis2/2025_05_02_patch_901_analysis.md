# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_901

## First error

```
../../components/subresource_filter/core/common/test_ruleset_creator.cc:55:7: error: reinterpret_cast from 'std::string' (aka 'basic_string<char>') to 'const uint8_t *' (aka 'const unsigned char *') is not allowed
   55 |       reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(ruleset_contents);
      |       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified ruleset_contents to base::span<const uint8_t>, but failed to remove the `reinterpret_cast`. `reinterpret_cast` from `std::string` to `const uint8_t *` is not allowed.

## Solution
The rewriter has spanified a variable but left a reinterpret_cast that is applied to it. Rewriter needs to be able to remove it.
```
-  base::span<const uint8_t> data =
-      reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(ruleset_contents);
+  base::span<const uint8_t> data =
+      ruleset_contents;
```

## Note
There was another error on line 56, it has the same root cause as this error.

```
../../components/subresource_filter/core/common/test_ruleset_creator.cc:56:31: error: no member named 'subspan' in 'std::string'
   56 |   return std::vector<uint8_t>(data.data(),
      |                               ^^^^^^^^^^^
