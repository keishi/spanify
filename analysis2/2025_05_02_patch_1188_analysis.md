# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1188

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The error occurs because the code is passing a signed integer value to `subspan()`, which expects an unsigned value. This causes a type mismatch and a compilation error. The rewriter should have added a cast to `size_t` to ensure that the value is unsigned.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to automatically cast the argument to `subspan()` to `size_t` to avoid this type mismatch.

```
       ShapeSize(arg0_rank - axis, arg0_shape.subspan(axis));
```

should be

```
       ShapeSize(arg0_rank - axis, arg0_shape.subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(axis)));
```

## Note
The build log also has a lot of errors like this

```

```

These errors are all related to the same root cause: The `SIMPLE_UNARY_OP` macro invokes `ShapeSize` with the original raw pointer `input_shape` after `ShapeSize` has been redefined to accept a span. To fix this, the rewriter should spanify variables inside of macros correctly.
