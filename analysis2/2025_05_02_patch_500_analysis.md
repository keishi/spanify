# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_500

## First error

```
../../media/base/sinc_resampler.h:104:55: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'pointer' (aka 'float *') to function return type 'base::span<float>'
  104 |   base::span<float> get_kernel_for_testing() { return kernel_storage_.get(); }
      |                                                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter changed the return type of `SincResampler::get_kernel_for_testing()` from `float*` to `base::span<float>`. However, it didn't update the return statement to construct the span properly. The `kernel_storage_.get()` method returns a raw pointer (`float*`), which is not directly convertible to a `base::span<float>` without additional information like the size of the underlying data. The compiler is complaining about the incompatible types in the return statement.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to construct a `base::span` from the raw pointer and the size of the buffer. It should use the `kernel_storage_size_` member to determine the size of the kernel. The corrected return statement should look like this:

```c++
base::span<float> get_kernel_for_testing() {
  return base::span<float>(kernel_storage_.get(), kernel_storage_size_);
}
```

## Note
The rewriter needs to not only change the function signature, but also update the implementation to correctly construct the `base::span`. Also, there were other compile errors due to missing `.data()` after this fix.
