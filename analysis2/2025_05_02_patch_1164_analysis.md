# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1164

## First error
../../base/memory/scoped_refptr.h:151:16: error: no matching constructor for initialization of 'media::AudioBuffer'
  151 |   T* obj = new T(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
      |                ^ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `AudioBuffer::CopyBitstreamFrom` was spanified in this patch. However, the call site in `media_type_converters.cc` was not updated to pass a `base::span` as an argument. Instead, it is passing a raw pointer `&data` to the function, which expects a `base::span<const uint8_t* const>`. This mismatch in the expected argument type causes the compiler to report "no matching constructor for initialization of 'media::AudioBuffer'".

## Solution
The rewriter needs to spanify the call site. It looks like it is failing to recognize that `CopyBitstreamFrom` needs to have its call sites updated.

## Note
The following code needs to be modified:
```c++
    return media::AudioBuffer::CopyBitstreamFrom(
        input->sample_format, input->channel_layout, input->channel_count,
        input->sample_rate, input->frame_count,
        base::span<uint8_t*, 1>(&data, 1u), input->data.size(),
        input->timestamp);
```
to be:
```c++
    uint8_t* data_ptr = input->data.data();
    return media::AudioBuffer::CopyBitstreamFrom(
        input->sample_format, input->channel_layout, input->channel_count,
        input->sample_rate, input->frame_count,
        base::span<const uint8_t* const>(&data_ptr, 1), input->data.size(),
        input->timestamp);
```
