# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_592

## First error

Overlapping replacements: ./components/media_router/common/providers/cast/certificate/cast_crl.cc at offset 17486, length 84: ").subspan( sizeof kCastFallbackCRLs /
                                                 sizeof)" and offset 17488, length 24: "(kCastFallbackCRLs.size() * sizeof(decltype(kCastFallbackCRLs)::value_type))"

## Category
Overlapping replacements between RewriteArraySizeof and AppendDataCall.

## Reason
The rewriter attempts to add `.data()` using the `AppendDataCall` rule and rewrite the `sizeof` expression using the `RewriteArraySizeof` rule. These replacements overlap in the code, causing a conflict. The `AppendDataCall` rule seems to be triggered first, then the `RewriteArraySizeof` rule attempts to rewrite the same area, causing the "Overlapping replacements" error.

## Solution
The rewriter should be modified to avoid overlapping replacements when both `AppendDataCall` and `RewriteArraySizeof` rules apply to the same expression. A possible solution is to ensure that the `RewriteArraySizeof` rule checks if a `.data()` call has already been added before attempting to rewrite the `sizeof` expression, or vice-versa. Another approach would be to combine the two transformations into a single, more complex rewrite.
