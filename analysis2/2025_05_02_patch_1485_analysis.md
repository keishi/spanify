# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1485

## First error

../../chrome/browser/shell_integration_linux.cc:678:21: error: no viable conversion from 'gchar *' (aka 'char *') to 'base::span<gchar>' (aka 'span<char>')

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The function `g_key_file_to_data` is a GLib function (third_party). The rewriter attempted to assign its return value (`gchar*`, which is `char*`) to `base::span<gchar> data_dump`.  However, the rewriter did not generate the necessary code to construct a span from the returned pointer.  The span needs to be constructed with both the pointer and the length.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to recognize the pattern where a raw pointer returned from a third-party function is assigned to a `base::span`. In such cases, it needs to generate code to explicitly construct a `base::span` using the returned pointer and the length.

The corrected line should look like:

```c++
base::span<gchar> data_dump(g_key_file_to_data(key_file, &length, NULL), length);
```

## Note
The second error is `../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'`. This happened because subspan is expecting an unsigned size, while the literal `1` is an int.
