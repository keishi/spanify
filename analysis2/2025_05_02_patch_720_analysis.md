# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_720

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h:834:27: error: no viable conversion from 'const volatile GLuint *' (aka 'const volatile unsigned int *') to 'base::span<const volatile GLuint>' (aka 'span<const volatile unsigned int>')
  834 |   DeleteTexturesHelper(n, textures);
      |                           ^~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The function `GLES2DecoderImpl::DeleteTexturesHelper` was spanified, but the call site in `gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h` passes a `const volatile GLuint*` which isn't implicitly convertible to `base::span<const volatile GLuint>`.  The `gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h` file is autogenerated, and therefore should have been excluded from spanification. The spanifier incorrectly spanified `DeleteTexturesHelper` even though a call site exists in excluded code.

## Solution
The spanifier should check for call sites in excluded code before spanifying a function. If any call sites are found in excluded code, spanification should be skipped for that function.

## Note
This is a case where the rewriter spanified a function, but the call site in the generated header file (`gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h`) was not updated.
