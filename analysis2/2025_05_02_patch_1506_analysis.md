# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1506

## First error
../../media/formats/mp4/hevc.cc:425:39: error: no member named 'subspan' in 'std::array<unsigned char, 4>'
  425 |                      kAnnexBStartCode.subspan(kAnnexBStartCodeSize).data());
      |                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The code was rewritten to use `std::to_array`, which creates an `std::array`. Then the code calls subspan() on that variable. Since `std::array` does not have a subspan() method, this results in an error. The rewriter should have recognized that `kAnnexBStartCode` was arrayified, and generate the code that applies subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to rewrite code that was using `subspan()` calls on arrayified variables. It should recognize that the variable is now an `std::array` and handle the `subspan()` function call appropriately. It likely involves adding `.data()` to the original variable like this:

```cpp
// Old code
kAnnexBStartCode.subspan(kAnnexBStartCodeSize).data()

// Corrected code:
base::span(kAnnexBStartCode).subspan(kAnnexBStartCodeSize).data()
