## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan()` method requires an unsigned integer as its argument. The variable `frame_offset_a` is an `int`, which is a signed integer. The compiler is complaining because there is no implicit conversion from `int` to `size_t` (the expected type) without a potential loss of data (negative values).

## Solution
Cast `frame_offset_a` to `size_t` before calling `subspan()`.  The rewriter needs to wrap the argument with `base::checked_cast<size_t>()`.

## Note
The other errors are caused by the rewriter failing to rewrite the increment operations on the `base::span` variables. The rewriter should have used pointer arithmetic on the `.data()` values.
