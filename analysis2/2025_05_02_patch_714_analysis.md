# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_714

## First error

../../components/power_bookmarks/core/bookmark_client_base.cc:20:24: error: redefinition of 'kSaveLocationStateHistogramBase' with a different type: 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') vs 'const char[]'

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `kSaveLocationStateHistogramBase` from `const char[]` in the header file to `const std::string_view` in the cc file. This caused a redefinition error since the header declares it as `const char[]`. The rewriter then incorrectly attempts to call `.data()` on `kSaveLocationStateHistogramBase` as if it was converted to std::string_view.

## Solution
The rewriter should not change the type of a variable declared in a header file to a different type in the implementation file. Also, it shouldn't attempt to call `.data()` if it didn't rewrite the underlying type to `std::string` or similar.

## Note
The rewriter also introduced a second error where it attempted to call `.data()` on `kSaveLocationStateHistogramBase`, which is an array and doesn't have a `.data()` method, but the root cause is the type change.
