# Build Failure: 2025_05_02_patch_294

## First error

```
../../mojo/public/cpp/bindings/lib/array_internal.h:182:25: error: member reference base type 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned long') is not a structure or union
  182 |             (offset / 8).data()),
      |             ~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The expression `(offset / 8).data()` attempts to call `.data()` on a `size_t`, which is an integer type and does not have a `data()` member. The rewriter should have avoided adding the `.data()` call to the integer. The surrounding code also has a `reinterpret_cast` which is not allowed on spanified variables.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to avoid calling `.data()` on integer types. It also needs to avoid `reinterpret_cast` on spanified variables.

## Note
There are other errors related to `reinterpret_cast`, so fixing the `.data()` issue will not be sufficient.
