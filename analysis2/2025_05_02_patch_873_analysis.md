## First error

```
../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan()` method of `base::span` requires an unsigned integer as its argument. In the original code, the expression `first_row / 2 * dest_stride_uv` is an `int`. The compiler is complaining that it cannot implicitly cast the `int` result to the `size_t` type expected by `subspan()` because `strict_cast` is used and the ranges are not compatible.

## Solution
The rewriter should wrap the argument to `subspan()` with `base::checked_cast<size_t>()` to ensure it is an unsigned integer. If the argument is already an unsigned integer literal, then it should append `u` to the literal.
```
dest_uv.subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(first_row / 2 * dest_stride_uv)).data()
```
