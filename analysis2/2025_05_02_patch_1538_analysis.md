## First error

../../url/url_canon_relative.cc:120:3: error: no matching function for call to 'TrimURL'

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `TrimURL` was spanified, but the call sites were not updated to pass a span. The error occurs in `url_canon_relative.cc` where `TrimURL` is called with a `const char* url` and `const char16_t* url`, but `TrimURL` now expects a `base::span<const CHAR> spec`. The rewriter updated the definition of `TrimURL`, but it did not update the calls to `TrimURL`.

## Solution
The rewriter should also update the call sites of `TrimURL` to pass a `base::span`. The rewriter needs to convert the `const char* url` and `const char16_t* url` into `base::span<const char>` and `base::span<const char16_t>`.

For example, in `url_canon_relative.cc`:

```c++
TrimURL(url, &begin, &url_len);
```

should be rewritten to:

```c++
TrimURL(base::span(url, url_len), &begin, &url_len);
```

Similar changes are necessary for other call sites of TrimURL.
