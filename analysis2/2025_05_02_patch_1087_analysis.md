# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1087

## First error

../../ipc/ipc_param_traits.h:22:17: error: static assertion failed due to requirement 'internal::AlwaysFalse<std::array<gfx::ColorSpace, 6>>::value': Cannot find the IPC::ParamTraits specialization. Did you forget to include the corresponding header file?

## Category
Rewriter needs to include the necessary headers for `std::array` when it replaces a C-style array with `std::array` in a class/struct.

## Reason
The rewriter replaced `gfx::ColorSpace color_spaces_[kConfigCount];` with `std::array<gfx::ColorSpace, kConfigCount> color_spaces_;`. However, the code in `gfx_param_traits.cc` and `gfx_param_traits.h` requires a specialization of `IPC::ParamTraits` for `std::array<gfx::ColorSpace, 6>`. This specialization is not found because the necessary header file is not included.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to automatically include the header file that provides the `IPC::ParamTraits` specialization for `std::array<gfx::ColorSpace, 6>`. In this case, including `"ui/gfx/color_space.h"` in `ui/gfx/ipc/color/gfx_param_traits.h` should fix the issue, because the `gfx::ColorSpace` must have a `ParamTraits` defined.
