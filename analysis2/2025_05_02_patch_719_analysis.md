## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h:1229:29: error: no viable conversion from 'GLuint *' (aka 'unsigned int *') to 'base::span<const GLuint>' (aka 'span<const unsigned int>')
 1229 |       !GenTexturesHelper(n, textures_safe)) {
      |                             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `GenTexturesHelper` was spanified. However, the call site in `gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h` passes a raw pointer `textures_safe` to it. The compiler cannot implicitly convert a raw pointer to a `base::span`.

## Solution
The rewriter should also spanify the call site in `gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h`.

## Note
The error occurs in the autogenerated file `gles2_cmd_decoder_autogen.h`, which is excluded from rewriting. Ideally the rewriter should not spanify functions that require rewriting excluded code.
