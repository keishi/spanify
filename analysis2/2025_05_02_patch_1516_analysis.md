# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1516

## First error

Overlapping replacements: ./base/strings/safe_sprintf_unittest.cc at offset 4822, length 12: "std::array<char, 20> ref" and offset 4822, length 21: "std::array<char, 20> buf"

## Category
Overlapping replacements due to multiple variable declaration.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to perform overlapping replacements on the same region of code in `safe_sprintf_unittest.cc`. Specifically, it is trying to replace two different variable declarations ("std::array<char, 20> ref" and "std::array<char, 20> buf") that start at the same offset (4822). This indicates a bug in the rewriter's logic for handling multiple variable declarations within the same scope.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be updated to correctly handle overlapping replacements arising from multiple variable declarations. It should either avoid generating replacements that overlap, or it should merge them into a single replacement that encompasses both declarations. A common scenario is when multiple variables are declared on the same line.

## Note
The error occurs in `base/strings/safe_sprintf_unittest.cc` and involves overlapping replacements for `ref` and `buf` variables.
