## First error

```
../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
../../media/capture/video/file_video_capture_device.cc:414:7: note: in instantiation of function template specialization 'base::internal::StrictNumeric<unsigned long>::StrictNumeric<int>' requested here
  414 |       VideoFrame::PlaneSize(PIXEL_FORMAT_I420, 0, crop_size).GetArea());
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `base::span::subspan()` method requires an unsigned integer as its argument for the offset. The code is passing the result of `VideoFrame::PlaneSize(...).GetArea()`, which returns an `int`. The compiler error indicates that `strict_cast` cannot convert the `int` to the expected `unsigned long` type.

## Solution
The rewriter should insert a cast to `size_t` (or `static_cast<size_t>`) around the argument passed to `subspan()` to ensure it is an unsigned type.

```c++
base::span<uint8_t> crop_up = crop_yp.subspan(
    VideoFrame::PlaneSize(PIXEL_FORMAT_I420, 0, crop_size).GetArea());
```

should be rewritten to:

```c++
base::span<uint8_t> crop_up = crop_yp.subspan(
    static_cast<size_t>(VideoFrame::PlaneSize(PIXEL_FORMAT_I420, 0, crop_size).GetArea()));
```
