# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1330

## First error

../../ui/base/clipboard/clipboard_test_template.h:616:9: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<uint32_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned int>') to 'const U8x4 *' (aka 'const array<unsigned char, 4> *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter inserted `UNSAFE_SKBITMAP_GETADDR32` which returns a `base::span<uint32_t>`. The code then attempts to `reinterpret_cast` the span to `const U8x4*`. This is not allowed. The rewriter should not be spanifying a variable and leaving a `reinterpret_cast` applied to it.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be able to remove the `reinterpret_cast`. This may involve more sophisticated rewrites or avoiding spanifying the variable in the first place if it is used in a `reinterpret_cast`.
