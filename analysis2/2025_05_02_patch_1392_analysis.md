# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1392

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:643:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The code attempts to use `base::span` to iterate through the `kShortcutWithSpacesTestProviders` array. However, `std::begin` returns a pointer (`policy::TestProvider*`), and there is no implicit conversion from a raw pointer to a `base::span`. This is because `base::span` needs to know the size of the underlying data, which is not conveyed by a raw pointer. The rewriter converted the type of the loop iterator to `base::span`, but didn't address the initialization, or the increment, which are invalid for spans.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to spanify the array `kShortcutWithSpacesTestProviders` itself instead of trying to make a span out of a raw pointer.

## Note
The other errors are consequences of the first error.
