# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_273

## First error
../../ui/events/ozone/evdev/tablet_event_converter_evdev_unittest.cc:401:54: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<struct input_event>' and 'long')

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `MockTabletEventConverterEvdev::ConfigureReadMock` was spanified. The `queue` parameter, which was originally `struct input_event* queue`, is now `base::span<struct input_event> queue`. The code attempts to perform pointer arithmetic on `queue`: `queue + queue_index`.  Since queue is now a span, this operation is invalid. The correct way to access a sub-range of the span is to use the `subspan()` method.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to automatically convert `queue + queue_index` to `queue.subspan(queue_index)`. The line should be rewritten as:
```
-  int nwrite = HANDLE_EINTR(write(write_pipe_, queue + queue_index,
+  int nwrite = HANDLE_EINTR(write(write_pipe_, queue.data() + queue_index,
```

## Note
The fix applied here only works with a raw span, since `write` is expecting a pointer. For `std::span`, one has to call `queue.subspan(queue_index).data()`.
