# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_747

## First error
../../gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder.cc:8738:27: error: const_cast from 'base::span<const volatile GLfloat>' (aka 'span<const volatile float>') to 'const GLfloat *' (aka 'const float *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `const volatile GLfloat* value` to `base::span<const volatile GLfloat> value`. However, there's still a `const_cast<const GLfloat*>(value)` in the code. The rewriter should have removed this cast, as it's no longer valid to cast from a span to a raw pointer in this context.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to identify and remove the `const_cast` after spanifying the variable. The cast is unnecessary because the function being called should now accept the `base::span` directly, or the rewriter should adapt the call site to use `.data()` if a raw pointer is required by the target function.
