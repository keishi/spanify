# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1767

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The error occurs when calling `payload.subspan(payload_size)` in the `WebMWebVTTParser` constructor. The `payload_size` argument is an `int`, but `subspan` requires an unsigned type (specifically, `size_t`). The `strict_cast` function in `base::numerics::safe_conversions.h` is used to perform safe numeric conversions, but it fails to find a suitable conversion from `int` to `size_t` in this context because the template constraints are not met.

## Solution
The rewriter should wrap the `payload_size` argument in `base::checked_cast<size_t>()` when calling `subspan`. This will ensure that the value is safely converted to an unsigned type before being passed to `subspan`.

## Note
There are additional errors in the build log:
1.  The code attempts to compare a `base::raw_span` with a `raw_ptr`, which is not allowed. The rewriter should ensure that both operands are of the same type, either by converting the `raw_ptr` to a `base::raw_span` or vice versa.
2.  The code attempts to increment the value of `ptr_`, which is now a `base::raw_span`. `base::raw_span` should not be incremented. The rewriter should use `.data()` to get the underlying raw pointer and increment that instead. This is also true for decrementing it.
