## First error

../../ui/gfx/skia_color_space_util.cc:102:10: error: no matching function for call to 'SkM44FromRowMajor3x3'

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `SkM44FromRowMajor3x3` has been spanified in `ui/gfx/skia_color_space_util.h`, but the call site within `ui/gfx/skia_color_space_util.cc` passes a raw pointer instead of a `base::span`. The error message "no known conversion from 'const float *' to 'base::span<const float>'" clearly indicates this.

## Solution
The call site in `SkcmsMatrix3x3FromSkM44` should construct a `base::span` from the raw pointer:

```c++
SkM44 COLOR_SPACE_EXPORT SkM44FromSkcmsMatrix3x3(const skcms_Matrix3x3& in) {
  return SkM44FromRowMajor3x3(base::span(&in.vals[0][0], 9));
}
```
Note that the size of the span is 9, because `skcms_Matrix3x3` is a 3x3 matrix which has 9 elements.

The rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the argument when calling a spanified function.

## Note
None
