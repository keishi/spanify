## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The constructor of `AudioBuffer` was spanified, taking `base::span<const uint8_t* const> data` as an argument. However, the call sites were not updated to pass a span. Instead, they are still passing `const uint8_t* const*`, leading to a type mismatch and the "no matching constructor" error.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to update the call sites of the `AudioBuffer` constructor to create a `base::span` from the `const uint8_t* const*` argument. This likely involves providing the size of the data being pointed to, which might be available in the surrounding context.
The rewriter must identify the size of the underlying `data` variable in the call sites and create spans accordingly.
For example, the call in `AudioBuffer::CreateEmpty` at `media/base/audio_buffer.cc:304` looks like this before the spanification:
```c++
  return base::MakeRefCounted<AudioBuffer>(
      base::PassKey<AudioBuffer>(), sample_format, channel_layout, channel_count,
      sample_rate, frame_count, create_buffer, data, size, timestamp, pool);
```
After spanification this should look like:
```c++
  return base::MakeRefCounted<AudioBuffer>(
      base::PassKey<AudioBuffer>(), sample_format, channel_layout, channel_count,
      sample_rate, frame_count, create_buffer, base::span(data,channel_count), size, timestamp, pool);
```

## Note
The build log shows multiple errors stemming from different call sites of the `AudioBuffer` constructor (`media/base/audio_buffer.cc:304`, `media/base/audio_buffer.cc:360`, `media/base/audio_buffer.cc:375`, `media/base/audio_buffer.cc:391`, `media/base/audio_buffer.cc:406`, `media/base/audio_buffer.cc:430`). This indicates a systematic issue where all call sites need to be updated to correctly pass a `base::span`. The size of the span needs to be extracted from somewhere. `channel_count` seems like a good candidate in some places.
