# Build Failure: 2025_05_02_patch_614

## First error

```
../../base/memory/raw_ptr_exclusion.h:11:10: fatal error: 'partition_alloc/pointers/raw_ptr_exclusion.h' file not found
   11 | #include "partition_alloc/pointers/raw_ptr_exclusion.h"  // IWYU pragma: export
      |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter added `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in `base/test/test_child_process.cc`. But this header transitively includes system headers which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition. `base/test/test_child_process.cc` file doesn't explicitly include `partition_alloc/pointers/raw_ptr_exclusion.h` but when span.h is added, it transitively includes this file.

## Solution
The rewriter is adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` which transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition. The rewriter needs to avoid adding include statements that cause this problem.

## Note
This is similar to the "Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors" error.
