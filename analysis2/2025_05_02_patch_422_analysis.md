## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The error occurs when calling `subspan()` with a signed integer `index`. The `subspan()` method expects an unsigned integer (size_t) as its argument.  The `strict_cast` in `safe_conversions.h` is failing because the compiler cannot guarantee that the signed integer `index` will always be non-negative, which is a requirement for safe conversion to an unsigned type.

## Solution
The rewriter should cast the argument to `subspan()` to an unsigned value using `base::checked_cast<size_t>()`. For example:
```c++
return schema_data_.required_properties.subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(index)).data();
```
Also include the relevant header:
```c++
#include "base/numerics/safe_conversions.h"
```
