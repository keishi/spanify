## First error

../../remoting/host/linux/remoting_user_session.cc:259:23: error: no viable conversion from 'char **' to 'base::span<char *>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to handle address of a spanified variable passed into a function.

## Reason
The function `pam_getenvlist` returns a `char**`. The rewriter is attempting to assign this `char**` directly to a `base::span<char*>`. However, a `char**` is not implicitly convertible to `base::span<char*>`. A `base::span` needs to know the size of the array it is referencing, and a `char**` does not provide that information directly.

## Solution
The correct way to construct a `span` from the return value of `pam_getenvlist` is not known, because there is no way to retrieve its size. The returned array of `char*` is null-terminated, and `span` doesn't support null-terminated arrays. Thus, we should not spanify `environment`.

## Note
The second error is `invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<char *>' and 'std::nullptr_t')`. This is because `base::span` is compared to `nullptr`. A span can be empty but it cannot be `nullptr`. Comparing span to `nullptr` is not a common use case.
The third error is `cannot increment value of type 'base::span<char *>'`. This is because the for loop is trying to increment the span itself. To loop over the span, we should loop over `environment.data()`.
