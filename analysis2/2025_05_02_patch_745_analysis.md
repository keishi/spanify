# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_745

## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder.cc:8692:27: error: const_cast from 'base::span<const volatile GLfloat>' (aka 'span<const volatile float>') to 'const GLfloat *' (aka 'const float *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter introduced a `base::span` for the `value` parameter in `GLES2DecoderImpl::DoUniform1fv`. However, within the function, the code attempts to `const_cast` this span to a `const GLfloat*`. This is invalid because `base::span` is not a pointer, and casting it to a pointer is not a valid operation. The root cause is the rewriter spanified the variable, but left a const_cast that is applied to it. The rewriter needs to be able to remove it.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to identify and remove invalid `const_cast` operations when spanifying variables.

## Note
The autogenerated code also had a compilation error, but it is addressed when the first error is addressed.
