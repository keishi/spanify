# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_624

## First error

../../device/bluetooth/dbus/fake_bluetooth_gatt_characteristic_client.cc:623:11: error: declaration of anonymous struct must be a definition
  623 |           struct(unnamed struct at / usr / local / google / home / nuskos /
      |           ^

## Category
Rewriter failed to handle cast of single variable span.

## Reason
The rewriter added conversion for single variable span, but not its cast. The original code
```c++
uint8_t* bytes = reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(&value);
```
was rewritten to
```c++
base::span<uint8_t> bytes = reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(
      base::span<
          struct(unnamed struct at / usr / local / google / home / nuskos /
                     chromium -
                 team / chromium / src / out / rewrite -
                 linux /../../ device / bluetooth / dbus /
                     fake_bluetooth_gatt_characteristic_client.cc : 588 : 3),
          1>(&value, 1u));
```
but the rewriter also needs to rewrite the `reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>` part.

## Solution
The rewriter should be able to rewrite the `reinterpret_cast` of single element spans.

```c++
base::span<uint8_t> bytes = reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(base::span<...>(&value, 1u));
```

should be rewritten to

```c++
base::span<uint8_t> bytes = reinterpret_cast<base::span<uint8_t>>(base::span<...>(&value, 1u));
```

## Note
There are two other errors. One is a syntax error from an incomplete `bytes.subspan(sizeof).data()(value)` which I believe is conflicting replacements. And another one from not being able to deduce the type for the unnamed struct.
