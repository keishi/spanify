## First error

../../base/memory/raw_ptr_exclusion.h:11:10: fatal error: 'partition_alloc/pointers/raw_ptr_exclusion.h' file not found

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter added `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in `components/cronet/native/sample/test/sample_test.cc`. But this header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside a class definition. In this case, the included file transitively includes `../../base/memory/raw_ptr_exclusion.h`, which includes `partition_alloc/pointers/raw_ptr_exclusion.h`. The error indicates a header inclusion issue caused by the added span include.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid including `base/containers/span.h` in header files or inside class declarations. It should only add this include to source files.

## Note
The spanification of `argv` is likely causing this error.
