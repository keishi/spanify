# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_783

## First error

invalid operands to binary expression ('element_type *' (aka 'std::pair<base::WaitableEvent *, unsigned long> *') and 'base::span<std::pair<WaitableEvent *, size_t>>' (aka 'span<pair<base::WaitableEvent *, unsigned long>>'))

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the `waitables` parameter in the `EnqueueMany` function. The code then attempts to iterate through the `waitables` span in reverse order using pointer arithmetic. Specifically, it calculates the starting pointer for the reverse iteration as `waitables.subspan(count - 1).data()`. However, the loop condition compares this pointer with the original `waitables` span, which is incorrect. This results in a type mismatch during the comparison, as the compiler is trying to compare a pointer (`element_type *`) with a `base::span`.

## Solution
The rewriter should either avoid spanifying the `waitables` parameter in the first place, or it should fully rewrite the loop to correctly use the span. In this case, reverting the spanification is probably the easiest solution.

## Note
The error occurs in `base/synchronization/waitable_event_posix.cc` line 348.
