# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1627

## First error

../../remoting/host/pam_authorization_factory_posix.cc:158:27: error: cannot initialize a member subobject of type 'int (*)(int, const struct pam_message **, struct pam_response **, void *)' with an lvalue of type 'int (int, base::span<const struct pam_message *>, struct pam_response **, void *)': type mismatch at 2nd parameter ('const struct pam_message **' vs 'base::span<const struct pam_message *>')

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The `PamConversation` function is a callback function whose signature is defined by the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) library. The rewriter modified the signature of this function to take a `base::span<const struct pam_message*>`, but the PAM library expects a `const struct pam_message**`. Since the PAM library calls this function, the signatures must match.  Because the callback function now has a different function signature than what the PAM library expects, the code fails to compile.

## Solution
The rewriter should not spanify function parameters when the function is used as a callback with a specific signature defined by an external interface (in this case, the PAM library).  The rewriter should recognize this pattern and avoid rewriting the function signature. The rewriter could detect that `PamConversation` is part of the `pam_conv` struct, and avoid rewriting that function.
