# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1586

## First error

```
../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
../../content/browser/blob_storage/blob_url_unittest.cc:306:66: note: in instantiation of function template specialization 'base::internal::StrictNumeric<unsigned long>::StrictNumeric<int>' requested here
  306 |         base::span<const char>(kTestFileSystemFileData2).subspan(6).data(), 7);
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan()` method expects an unsigned integer as its argument, but the code is passing a signed integer literal. The compiler is complaining about the implicit conversion from a signed integer to an unsigned integer, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the signed integer is negative.

## Solution
The rewriter should cast the argument to `subspan()` to an unsigned integer. This can be done by appending `u` to the integer literal or by explicitly casting the value to `size_t`. In this specific case, the line should be rewritten as follows:
```c++
*expected_result += std::string(
    base::span<const char>(kTestFileSystemFileData2).subspan(6u).data(), 7);
```
or
```c++
*expected_result += std::string(
    base::span<const char>(kTestFileSystemFileData2).subspan(static_cast<size_t>(6)).data(), 7);
```

## Note
The error is happening within the `base::numerics::safe_conversions.h` header file, which indicates that the compiler is trying to perform a safe conversion from a signed integer to an unsigned integer, but it's failing because the value might be out of range.
