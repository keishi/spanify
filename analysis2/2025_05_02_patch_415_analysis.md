# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_415

## First error
```
../../ui/events/ozone/evdev/event_device_test_util.cc:73:9: error: no matching function for call to 'EvdevSetBit'
   73 |         EvdevSetBit(&(*out)[0], code);
      |         ^~~~~~~~~~~
../../ui/events/ozone/evdev/event_device_util.h:33:20: note: candidate function not viable: no known conversion from 'value_type *' (aka 'unsigned long *') to 'base::span<unsigned long>' for 1st argument
   33 | static inline void EvdevSetBit(base::span<unsigned long> data, int bit) {
      |                    ^           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `EvdevSetBit` was spanified to take a `base::span<unsigned long>` as input. However, at the call site in `event_device_test_util.cc`, the code is passing `&(*out)[0]`, which is an `unsigned long*`. The compiler cannot implicitly convert a raw pointer to a `base::span`. The rewriter failed to update the call site to construct a `base::span` from the pointer and the size.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to identify all call sites of spanified functions and ensure that the arguments are correctly converted to spans when necessary. In this case, the call site should be updated to construct a span from the pointer and size like this:

```c++
EvdevSetBit(base::span(&(*out)[0], out->size()), code);
```

## Note
The other errors are in `event_converter_evdev_impl_unittest.cc` and `touch_event_converter_evdev_unittest.cc`. They are similar to this error, in the sense that the arguments to `EvdevSetBit` were not properly converted to `base::span`.
