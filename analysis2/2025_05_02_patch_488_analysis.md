# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_488

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/core/imagebitmap/image_bitmap_test.cc:383:30: error: no viable conversion from 'const uint32_t *' (aka 'const unsigned int *') to 'base::span<const uint32_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned int>')

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The code attempts to assign a raw pointer `pixmap.addr32()` to a `base::span<const uint32_t> pixels`. The `pixmap.addr32()` function returns a raw pointer, and the compiler cannot implicitly convert a raw pointer to a `base::span` without knowing the size of the data being pointed to. The rewriter did not recognize the `pixmap.addr32()` function as providing a size alongside the pointer, or failed to rewrite the callsite.

## Solution
The rewriter should recognize when a raw pointer is being assigned to a `base::span` and attempt to determine the size of the data being pointed to. In this specific case, `pixmap` presumably has a size that could be used to construct the span. The rewriter logic should extract the size information, and create an edge from the size calculation node to `pixels`, then rewrite the assignment to construct the span.

For instance, we can consult the `SkPixmap` class which contains width and height:
https://skia.googlesource.com/skia/+/refs/heads/main/include/core/SkPixmap.h

```c++
  383 |   base::span<const uint32_t> pixels = pixmap.addr32();
```

should be rewritten to something like

```c++
  383 |   base::span<const uint32_t> pixels(pixmap.addr32(), pixmap.width() * pixmap.height());
```

## Note
The file in question is in `third_party/`, but it's in `third_party/blink/`, which is explicitly allowed to be rewritten.
