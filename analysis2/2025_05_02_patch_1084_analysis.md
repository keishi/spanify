## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `base::span::subspan()` method requires an unsigned integer as its argument. The rewriter generated code that passes `current_test_ - 1` to `subspan()`, where `current_test_` is an integer. When `current_test_` is 0, the expression `current_test_ - 1` evaluates to -1, which is a signed integer. The `strict_cast` in `safe_conversions.h` then fails because it cannot safely convert a negative signed integer to an unsigned integer.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to explicitly cast the argument to `subspan()` to an unsigned type (e.g., `size_t`) to ensure that the value is always non-negative. This can be done using `base::checked_cast<size_t>()`.

Example:
```c++
test_flags_.subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(current_test_ - 1)).data()
```
This ensures that the value passed to `subspan()` is a `size_t`, preventing the compilation error.
