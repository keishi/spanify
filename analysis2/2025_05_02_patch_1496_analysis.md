# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1496

## First error

../../media/base/audio_bus_unittest.cc:520:36: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('const size_t' (aka 'const unsigned long') and 'std::unique_ptr<AudioBus>')

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The replacement for `.data()` and `.subspan()` are conflicting and placed in the wrong place. The code intends to get the number of channels from the bus and then multiply it by a start offset. However, it's trying to perform the multiplication of a number and a pointer. This implies that `.data()` was not added in the right place, or that `.subspan()` was added in the wrong place.

## Solution
The rewriter logic should prioritize the `.data()` replacement to adapt correctly the `.subspan()` replacement.

## Note
No further errors.
