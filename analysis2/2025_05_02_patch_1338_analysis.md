# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1338

## First error

ninja: Entering directory `out/linux'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The build failed because the spanifier attempted to rewrite the `RealInitFunction` function signature to accept `base::span<char*> argv`. However, this change is not compatible with the standard `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function signature that libfuzzer expects, which uses `int argc, char** argv`. Since `RealInitFunction` is called by libfuzzer, it is excluded code, so it shouldn't have been spanified.

## Solution
The spanifier should avoid rewriting functions that are part of the libfuzzer API or are called by functions in libfuzzer such as the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`. The spanifier needs to detect that a function is used by a known external interface and avoid modifying its signature. Alternatively, the rewriter can verify that after spanifying the function, all of its call sites can be updated to use the new signature.

## Note
The error message "ninja: Entering directory `out/linux'`" does not directly indicate the root cause of the failure. The relevant information is that spanifying `RealInitFunction` breaks compatibility with libfuzzer's expectations.
