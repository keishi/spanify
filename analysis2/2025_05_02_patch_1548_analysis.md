## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan()` method of `base::span` requires an unsigned integer as its argument. In the original code, `ch` is of type `int`. The compiler is unable to find a suitable `strict_cast` function to convert the signed integer to an unsigned integer.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to cast `ch` to `size_t` before passing it to `subspan()`. This can be achieved by using `base::checked_cast<size_t>(ch)`. The corrected line would look like this:

```c++
_mm_store_ss(dot_product.subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(ch)).data(),
```

The rewriter should also add the following include:

```c++
#include "base/numerics/safe_conversions.h"
```

## Note
The second error is a type mismatch. This occurred because `MultiChannelDotProduct_SSE` was previously defined to take a `float*` argument, and is now being defined (by the lambda) to take a `base::span<float>` argument. This is outside the scope of spanification, because it requires changing the function declaration.
