# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1583

## First error

```
../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The error occurs because `subspan()` expects an unsigned integer as its argument, but the code is passing a signed integer. The rewriter does not automatically cast the signed integer to an unsigned integer, leading to a compilation error. The specific error message `no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'` indicates that the `strict_cast` function, which is used internally by `subspan` to ensure safe conversions, cannot find a suitable overload to convert the signed integer to an unsigned integer.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to add a cast to `size_t` or `uint64_t` (depending on the platform) when calling `subspan()` with a signed integer argument. This can be done by wrapping the argument with `base::checked_cast<size_t>()`, as suggested in the documentation.

## Note
The second error indicates that `kTestFileSystemFileData1` is defined as `std::string_view`, but `TestSuccessNonrangeRequest` expects `std::string`. Need to convert `std::string_view` to `std::string` with `.ToString()`.
