# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_96

## First error

../../third_party/libc++/src/include/__algorithm/fill_n.h:74:19: error: cannot increment value of type 'std::array<unsigned char, 16>'

## Category
Rewriter needs to handle arrayified `char[]` variable used with std::fill_n.

## Reason
The code uses `std::fill_n` with an element of the `scaling_list_4x4` member, which has been converted to `std::array<std::array<uint8_t, kScalingListSizeId0Count>, kNumScalingListMatrices>`. `std::fill_n` requires incrementing the iterator, but in this case, the iterator is pointing to an `std::array<unsigned char, 16>`, which cannot be incremented in the same way as a pointer.  The `std::fill_n` algorithm requires a forward iterator, and `std::array` does not decay into a pointer as a C-style array would.

## Solution
The rewriter should insert `.data()` when passing the `std::array` to `std::fill_n` so that it passes a pointer to the underlying array. For example, the original code `std::fill_n(scaling_list_data->scaling_list_4x4[matrix_id], ...)` should be rewritten to `std::fill_n(scaling_list_data->scaling_list_4x4[matrix_id].data(), ...)`

## Note
There are also errors with assignments to `uint8_t*` from the `std::array`, which also suggests the rewriter should have added `.data()` at the point of usage.
