# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_228

## First error

```
../../sandbox/linux/syscall_broker/broker_simple_message_unittest.cc:254:28: error: expected expression
  254 |   return dst.subspan(sizeof)(BrokerSimpleMessage::EntryType);
      |                            ^
```

## Category
Conflict between ".data()" and ".subspan()" replacements.

## Reason
The rewriter appears to be generating code that attempts to call `.subspan()` with an argument that looks like a sizeof, but the parentheses are misplaced, and there is a second set of parenthesis enclosing the subsequent argument, which is not correct.
The arguments to `subspan` must be within the same parenthesis.
The intention was to advance the pointer `dst` and return the new span.

## Solution
The rewriter should generate the correct code for calling `subspan` with the size.
```
  return dst.subspan(sizeof(BrokerSimpleMessage::EntryType));
```
This correctly specifies that `sizeof(BrokerSimpleMessage::EntryType)` is the argument for the call to `subspan`.

## Note
There are other errors related to the calculation of the remaining span sizes and `.data()` calls.
