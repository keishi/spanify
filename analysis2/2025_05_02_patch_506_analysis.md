# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_506

## First error

../../media/base/sinc_resampler.cc:139:22: error: assigning to 'ConvolveProc' (aka 'float (*)(const int, const float *, const float *, const float *, double)') from incompatible type 'float (const int, const float *, const float *, base::span<const float>, double)': type mismatch at 4th parameter ('const float *' vs 'base::span<const float>')

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The error indicates a type mismatch when assigning `SincResampler::Convolve_SSE` to the `convolve_proc_` member. The function pointer `convolve_proc_` expects a `const float*` as the fourth argument, but `SincResampler::Convolve_SSE` now takes a `base::span<const float>`. This means that the rewriter only updated the signature of `Convolve_SSE` but didn't update the function pointer type definition or the call sites that use this function pointer, causing the type mismatch.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to ensure that when a function signature is modified to use `base::span`, all related function pointer types and call sites are also updated accordingly to reflect this change. Specifically, in this case:

1.  Update the declaration of `ConvolveProc` to accept `base::span<const float>` as the fourth argument instead of `const float*`.
2.  Check other call sites of `convolve_proc_` and update them accordingly to create `base::span<const float>` instead of passing `const float*`.

## Note
The second error "no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'" is likely a follow-up error due to changes in the way `subspan` is used and is not the root cause.
