# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1676

## First error

```
../../gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_stub.h:14:7: error: missing '}' at end of definition of 'gpu::gles2::GLES2InterfaceStub'
   14 | class GLES2InterfaceStub : public GLES2Interface {
      |       ^
```

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter is adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in `gpu/command_buffer/client/gles2_interface_stub_autogen.h`. But this header transitively includes system headers like `<string.h>` which are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is invalid C++ syntax inside the GLES2InterfaceStub class definition.

## Solution
The rewriter should not add includes inside class definitions. Or it should avoid including system headers in header files altogether. Specifically, the interface files should not be including base::span. This is because the stubs are often used in contexts where span is not available, such as IPC.
