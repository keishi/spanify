# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1618

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The code `base::span<const char>(kWriteData).subspan(kWriteDataSize / 2)` passes `kWriteDataSize / 2` which is an `int`, to the `subspan` method, which requires an unsigned value.  The rewriter needs to insert a cast to `size_t` or `unsigned` to resolve this type mismatch.

```c++
  write_list.push_back(net::MockWrite(
      net::SYNCHRONOUS,
      base::span<const char>(kWriteData).subspan(kWriteDataSize / 2),
      kWriteDataSize / 2));
```

## Solution
The rewriter should wrap the argument to `subspan()` with `base::checked_cast<size_t>()` to ensure it is an unsigned value. Also, the include `base/numerics/safe_conversions.h` must be added to the file.

```c++
  write_list.push_back(net::MockWrite(
      net::SYNCHRONOUS,
      base::span<const char>(kWriteData).subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(kWriteDataSize / 2)),
      kWriteDataSize / 2));
```

## Note
There is another error about `no matching constructor for initialization of 'net::MockWrite'`. This is likely due to the first error causing the compiler to not be able to infer the correct type for the constructor.
