# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_834

## First error

../../media/formats/common/offset_byte_queue.cc:41:20: error: non-pointer operand type 'base::raw_span<const uint8_t, AllowPtrArithmetic | DanglingUntriaged>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char, dynamic_extent, raw_ptr<const unsigned char, (RawPtrTraits)9U | AllowPtrArithmetic>>') incompatible with nullptr

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The code attempts to assign a `base::raw_span` to `nullptr`, which is not a valid operation. The rewriter changed `buf_` from a raw pointer to `base::raw_span`.  The line `*buf = size_ > 0 ? buf_ : nullptr;` now attempts to assign a `base::raw_span` object where a `uint8_t` is expected.

## Solution
The ternary statement's second argument should be changed to create a 0-sized span. The rewriter should generate:
`*buf = size_ > 0 ? buf_ : base::span<const uint8_t>();`
or similar code that creates a zero-size span.

## Note
The second error says that base::span has no method named AsEphemeralRawAddr. This is likely because the original code expected a raw pointer to be passed to Peek.
