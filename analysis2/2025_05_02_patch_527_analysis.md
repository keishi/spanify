# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_527

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/core/css/properties/css_bitset.h:158:35: error: no matching constructor for initialization of 'Iterator'
  158 |   Iterator begin() const { return Iterator(chunks_.data(), 0, 0); }
      |                                   ^        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The rewriter changed `chunks_` to a `base::span<const uint64_t>`. The original code `chunks_.data()` returns `const uint64_t*`, which is then passed to the `Iterator` constructor. The `Iterator` constructor expects `base::span<const uint64_t>` as the first argument, not `const uint64_t*`.

## Solution
The rewriter spanified the `chunks_` member but didn't update the call sites to construct an iterator from the span. The `begin()` and `end()` methods of `CSSBitsetBase` should construct an `Iterator` by passing the `chunks_` member directly.

```

## Note
The `chunks_.data()` should be replaced with `chunks_` in the `begin()` and `end()` methods.
