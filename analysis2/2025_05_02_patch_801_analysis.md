# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_801

## First error

../../base/metrics/persistent_memory_allocator.h:451:12: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'base::FieldTrial::FieldTrialEntry *' to function return type 'base::span<base::FieldTrial::FieldTrialEntry>'

## Category
Rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The function `PersistentMemoryAllocator::GetAsObject` was changed to return a `base::span<T>`, but the code that uses the return value was not updated to account for this change. Specifically, `GetAsObject` returns a span, but the return value is directly used as a pointer in `field_trial.cc`. Thus the return value must be `span.data()` to get a pointer.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to add `.data()` to all the call sites of the function  `PersistentMemoryAllocator::GetAsObject`. The rewriter should look for functions whose return type was spanified and add `.data()` if the call site expects a pointer.

## Note
This issue can be fixed by adding `.data()` to the following files:
*   `base/metrics/field_trial.cc`
*   `base/metrics/persistent_histogram_allocator.cc`
*   `base/metrics/persistent_memory_allocator_unittest.cc`
