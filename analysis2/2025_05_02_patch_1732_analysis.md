# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1732

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
Similar to the previous failure, the `base::span::subspan()` method requires its arguments to be unsigned. The rewriter converted `destination += 3;` to `destination = destination.subspan(3);` but did not add the appropriate cast to `size_t`.  The `3` is being implicitly treated as a signed integer, leading to a type mismatch.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to insert an explicit cast to `size_t` when calling subspan with a literal. The corrected line should be `destination = destination.subspan(static_cast<size_t>(3));`

## Note
The second error occurs because the call site `convertToRGBFloat` was not correctly updated to pass a `base::span<float>` instead of a `float*`. This call site needs to use `base::span` as well, or a `.data()` call needs to be added to `static_cast<float*>(data)`.
