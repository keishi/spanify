## First error

../../chrome/browser/devtools/device/usb/android_usb_browsertest.cc:293:35: error: cannot cast from type 'const std::string' (aka 'const basic_string<char>') to pointer type 'unsigned char *'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter has spanified `x`, but the code attempts to cast `data` (a `std::string`) to `unsigned char*` and assign it to `x`. Casting a `std::string` directly to a `unsigned char*` is not allowed.

## Solution
The rewriter should remove the cast `(unsigned char*)` and replace `data` with `base::as_bytes(base::make_span(data))`. This will correctly create a `base::span<unsigned char>` from the `std::string` and assign it to `x`.

## Note
The second error occurs because `x++` is invalid for `base::span<unsigned char>`. This is a secondary effect of the first error.
