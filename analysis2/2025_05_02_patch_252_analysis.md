# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_252

## First error
../../media/muxers/mp4_movie_box_writer.cc:293:30: error: no viable conversion from 'const int *' to 'base::span<const int>'

## Category
Rewriter doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The code is trying to assign the result of `std::begin(box_->matrix)` to a `base::span<const int>`.  `std::begin` on an array returns a raw pointer (`const int*`), and there's no implicit conversion from a raw pointer to a `base::span` in this context.

## Solution
The rewriter should be able to recognize assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end and rewrite it to create span out of it.
```
base::span<const int> it = base::span(std::begin(box_->matrix), std::end(box_->matrix));
```

## Note
The second error is a consequence of the first. Since it is a span, it cannot be incremented.
