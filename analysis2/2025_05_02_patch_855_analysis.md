# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_855

## First error
services/on_device_model/fake/fake_chrome_ml_api.cc:408:22: error: cannot initialize a member subobject of type 'ChromeMLTokenizeFn' ... type mismatch at 2nd parameter ('const uint8_t *' (aka 'const unsigned char *') vs 'base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>'))

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The rewriter modified the signature of `TokenizeBytes` to accept a `base::span<const uint8_t>`, but the `ChromeMLApi::Init` method expects `ChromeMLTokenizeFn` which is a function pointer to a function that takes a `const uint8_t*`.  The rewriter changed the signature of `TokenizeBytes` without considering that it is assigned to a function pointer with a different signature. The code is trying to assign a function pointer to another function pointer with different argument types.

## Solution
The rewriter should create a lambda that adapts the `base::span` to a raw pointer.

```cpp
   .tokenize_fn = [](const void* user_data, const uint8_t* bytes,
                      size_t bytes_len, uint32_t* output_tokens,
                      size_t output_tokens_len) {
     return TokenizeBytes(user_data, base::span(bytes, bytes_len), bytes_len,
                          output_tokens, output_tokens_len);
   },
```

Or, the rewriter should spanify the ChromeMLTokenizeFn to also accept a base::span.
