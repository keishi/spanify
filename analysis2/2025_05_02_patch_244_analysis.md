# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_244

## First error

```
../../base/trace_event/trace_arguments.cc:268:17: error: no viable conversion from 'span<element_type>' (aka 'span<char>') to 'const char *'
  268 |     const char* end = ptr.subspan(alloc_size);
      |                 ^     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified `storage` to `base::span<char>`. However, the code attempts to assign the result of `ptr.subspan(alloc_size)` to `const char* end`. The `subspan` method returns a `base::span`, not a `const char*`, hence the error. The rewriter didn't correctly adapt the code to account for the spanified variable and its methods.

## Solution
The rewriter must be updated to add `.data()` to the end of `ptr.subspan(alloc_size)` so it can convert to `const char *`.

## Note
There are other errors because the rewriter also failed to pass `char**` to function `CopyTraceEventParameter`. The first error is the most important.
