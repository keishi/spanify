# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1683

## First error

```
../../third_party/blink/renderer/core/layout/inline/inline_break_token.h:155:24: error: expected expression
  155 |   std::array<RareData, > rare_data_;
      |                        ^
```

## Category
Rewriter cannot get the size of forward declared array variable.

## Reason
The rewriter arrayified `rare_data_`, but couldn't determine the size because it is a forward declaration without a specified size. `RareData rare_data_[]` was converted to `std::array<RareData, > rare_data_;` which is invalid C++.

## Solution
The rewriter should not arrayify `rare_data_` if it cannot determine the size of the array. The rewriter should check if the size is available before attempting to rewrite the array.
