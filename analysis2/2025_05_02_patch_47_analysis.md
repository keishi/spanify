# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_47

## First error

../../chrome/services/file_util/public/cpp/sandboxed_rar_analyzer_unittest.cc:99:46: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('const base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'const span<const unsigned char>') and 'const size_t' (aka 'const unsigned long'))

## Category
Rewriter failed to apply subspan rewrite to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `sha256_digest` to a `base::span`, but failed to rewrite the expression `data.sha256_digest + crypto::kSHA256Length`. Since `sha256_digest` is now a `base::span`, pointer arithmetic is not valid, so `+` is an invalid operator. The correct way to get a span of `crypto::kSHA256Length` is to call `.subspan(0, crypto::kSHA256Length)`. But it seems that the rewriter failed to add it.

## Solution
The rewriter should add `.subspan(0, crypto::kSHA256Length)` to the span.

## Note
Also, the test data is using const uint8_t[], but the new struct takes base::span<const uint8_t>. This is another error. The rewriter should handle initialization with C arrays.
