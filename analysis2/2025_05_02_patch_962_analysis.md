## First error

../../ui/gfx/nine_image_painter.cc:121:17: error: static assertion failed due to requirement 'std::size(image_reps) == std::extent<std::array<gfx::ImageSkia, 9>, 0>()':

## Category
Rewriter cannot get the size of forward declared array variable.

## Reason
The rewriter changed `ImageSkia images_[9]` to `std::array<ImageSkia, 9> images_`. In the constructor, there is a static assert that checks the size of `image_reps` against `images_`. The compiler is unable to determine the size of `decltype(images_)` in the static assert. This is likely because the definition of `ImageSkia` is not available in the header file `ui/gfx/nine_image_painter.h`.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid arrayifying variables if the definition of its type is not available in the header.

## Note
The error can be fixed by including `"ui/gfx/image/image_skia.h"` in `ui/gfx/nine_image_painter.h`.
