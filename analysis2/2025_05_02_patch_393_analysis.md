## First error
../../ui/gfx/shadow_value_unittest.cc:30:31: error: no matching function for call to 'to_array'

## Category
Rewriter doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The code uses `std::to_array` with an initializer list. The error message `cannot convert initializer list argument to 'TestCase'` indicates that the compiler is unable to deduce the type and size of the array from the initializer list. The rewriter is not correctly handling the rewrite of the initializer list into an array.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to correctly handle the conversion of a C-style array to `std::array` when using `std::to_array` with an initializer list. In this case, the `TestCase` struct should be properly constructed when using `std::to_array`. The fix may involve explicitly specifying the type and size of the `std::array` in the `std::to_array` call or handling the initializer list more effectively during the rewrite.

## Note
The code change introduced the error by converting the C-style array `ShadowValue shadows[2]` to `std::array<ShadowValue, 2> shadows`. The compiler can't automatically construct the `std::array` from the initializer list without help from the rewriter.
