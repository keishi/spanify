## First error

../../media/parsers/vp9_uncompressed_header_parser.cc:589:7: error: suggest braces around initialization of subobject [-Werror,-Wmissing-braces]

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The error occurs in `vp9_uncompressed_header_parser.cc` and suggests braces around the initialization of a subobject, meaning there is an issue with initialization of `Vp9UncompressedHeaderParser::kIntraProbs`. This is likely due to the conversion of `mv_class_probs` from a C-style array to `std::array`.

## Solution
The rewriter converted `mv_class_probs` to `std::array`, but it seems like the initialization of `kIntraProbs` in `vp9_uncompressed_header_parser.cc` expects a different structure. This needs to be updated manually to correctly initialize the nested `std::array`. Add explicit braces for each sub-array within `kIntraProbs` to match the structure of `std::array<std::array<Vp9Prob, 10>, 2>`.

For example:

```c++
const Vp9Prob Vp9UncompressedHeaderParser::kIntraProbs[NUM_INTRA_PROB_MODES] = {
    {{224, 144, 192, 168, 192, 176, 192, 198, 198, 245}},
    {{216, 128, 176, 160, 176, 176, 192, 198, 198, 208}}
};
```

## Note
The secondary error indicates an excess number of elements in the struct initializer, which further confirms the need for correct brace initialization to match the expected structure of `std::array<std::array<Vp9Prob, 10>, 2>`.
