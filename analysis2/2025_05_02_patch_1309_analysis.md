## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/fonts/script_run_iterator_test.cc:288:27: error: redefinition of 'kTable' with a different type: 'const int[]' vs 'const std::array<int, 16>'

## Category
Rewriter modified code in a way that introduced a redefinition error.

## Reason
The rewriter changed the declaration of `kTable` from `static const int kTable[16];` to `static const std::array<int, 16> kTable;`. However, the definition of `kTable` was not updated, so the compiler is seeing `const int MockScriptData::kTable[] = { ... };` which is a different type.

## Solution
The rewriter should also update the definition of `kTable` to match the declaration using `std::array`.
```c++
const std::array<int, 16> MockScriptData::kTable = {
    kLatin,
    kHan,
    kGreek,
    kLatin2 + kHan,
    kLatin2 + kGreek,
    kHan2 + kLatin,
    kHan2 + kGreek,
    kGreek2 + kLatin,
    kGreek2 + kHan,
    kLatin3 + kHan2 + kGreek,
    kLatin3 + kGreek2 + kHan,
    kHan3 + kLatin2 + kGreek,
    kHan3 + kGreek2 + kLatin,
    kGreek3 + kLatin2 + kHan,
    kGreek3 + kHan2 + kLatin,
};
```

## Note
There are many other errors related to undeclared identifiers. These errors are likely because the variables `kLatin`, `kHan`, `kGreek`, etc are not defined in the scope of the new definition of `kTable`. This should be fixed as well by making sure that these identifiers are defined before `kTable` is defined.
