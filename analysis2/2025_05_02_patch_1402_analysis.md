# Build Failure: 2025_05_02_patch_1402

## First error

```
../../remoting/base/compound_buffer.cc:153:10: error: no viable conversion from 'net::IOBufferWithSize' to 'base::span<char>'
  153 |   CopyTo(*result, total_bytes_);
      |          ^~~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The function `CompoundBuffer::CopyTo` was spanified. This required spanifying the call site in `CompoundBuffer::ToIOBufferWithSize`, but this function uses the `net::IOBufferWithSize` class. The `net::IOBufferWithSize` class is defined in `net/base/io_buffer.h`. The `net/` folder is excluded from spanification, so the rewriter should not spanify functions that require spanifying excluded code.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code. In this case, the rewriter should not have spanified `CompoundBuffer::CopyTo`.

## Note
The second error is:

```
../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
../../remoting/base/compound_buffer.cc:162:25: note: in instantiation of function template specialization 'base::internal::StrictNumeric<unsigned long>::StrictNumeric<int>' requested here
  162 |     memcpy(data.subspan(pos).data(), it->start, bytes_to_copy);
      |                         ^
```
This error occurs because `bytes_to_copy` is an `int`, but `data.subspan()` requires an `unsigned long`. This is a known issue with the rewriter. The rewriter should cast the argument to `data.subspan()` to an unsigned value.
