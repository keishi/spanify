# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_409

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webaudio/wave_shaper_handler.cc:489:11: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<__m128i, 1>' to 'int32_t *' (aka 'int *') is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter has spanified a variable but left a reinterpret_cast that is applied to it. `index1` is being converted to a span, and then immediately cast back to `int32_t*`. This is invalid and unnecessary.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be able to remove the reinterpret_cast when it spanifies a variable. It should identify when this pattern occurs and adjust the generated code to avoid the illegal cast.
