# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1395

## First error

../../components/search_engines/enterprise/site_search_policy_handler_unittest.cc:707:41: error: no viable conversion from 'policy::(anonymous namespace)::TestProvider *' to 'base::span<policy::TestProvider>'

## Category
Rewriter doesn't handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The rewriter attempts to assign the iterators from `std::begin` and `std::end` to a `base::span`. A `base::span` should be initialized with a range like an array or a container (e.g., vector). It is not directly assignable from iterators.

## Solution
The rewriter should not have spanified the iterator variable. The iterator variable should continue to be a pointer.

## Note
The second error shows that the code attempts to increment the `base::span` object which is also incorrect because it is being used as an iterator.
