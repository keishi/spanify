## First error

../../base/check_op.h:229:26: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('const base::span<int>' and 'void *const')
  229 | DEFINE_CHECK_OP_IMPL(EQ, ==)
      | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter has spanified the `wire_fds` variable, but it is still being compared to `nullptr` using `DCHECK_EQ`. `DCHECK_EQ` expands to a comparison using `==`, and there is no `operator==` defined between `base::span<int>` and `void*`. Also, `wire_fds` is being assigned to `reinterpret_cast<int*>(CMSG_DATA(cmsg))` but it should not be using `reinterpret_cast` after being spanified.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be able to remove reinterpret_casts after spanifying a variable. In this case it should be removed entirely and replaced with `{}` to be initialized to be empty. If it needs to check for empty, it should be rewritten as `wire_fds.empty()`.
```
# before
wire_fds = reinterpret_cast<int*>(CMSG_DATA(cmsg));

# after
wire_fds = {};

# before
DCHECK_EQ(wire_fds, static_cast<void*>(nullptr));

# after
DCHECK(wire_fds.empty());
```

## Note
The rewriter should be able to handle other comparison operators as well, such as `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`.
