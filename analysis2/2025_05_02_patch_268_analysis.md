# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_268

## First error

```
../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/transforms/transform_operations_test.cc:121:26: error: no matching function for call to 'to_array'
  121 |   auto test_transforms = std::to_array<std::array<std::array<float, 3>, 2>>({
      |                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter cannot get the size of forward declared array variable.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to use `std::to_array` to initialize `test_transforms`. `std::to_array` requires the size of the array to be known at compile time, and it has to deduce the size from the initializer list. In this case, the rewriter seems to be failing to deduce the correct size. The type specified `std::array<std::array<float, 3>, 2>` does not match the type and size of the provided initializer list. The list contains *three* elements of type `std::array<float,3>,2>`, but the rewriter specifies it to be size two.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to correctly deduce the size of the array from the initializer list or refrain from using `std::to_array` if it cannot reliably determine the size. In this case, the rewriter should use `std::array` with the explicit size 3.

## Note
The original code used a C-style array, where the size was implicitly deduced from the initializer list. The rewriter is trying to use `std::to_array`, which was introduced in C++20, to provide a more typesafe alternative, however the size argument is incorrect.
