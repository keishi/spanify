# Build Failure: 2025_05_02_patch_589

## First error

```
../../ui/gfx/skbitmap_operations_unittest.cc:57:7: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<uint32_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned int>') to 'unsigned char *' is not allowed
   57 |       reinterpret_cast<unsigned char*>(UNSAFE_SKBITMAP_GETADDR32(bmp, 0, 0));
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter introduced `UNSAFE_SKBITMAP_GETADDR32(bmp, 0, 0)` which produces a `base::span<uint32_t>`, however there is still a `reinterpret_cast<unsigned char*>` around it. The compiler does not allow `reinterpret_cast` from span to a raw pointer.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be able to remove the `reinterpret_cast` in this case. One approach would be to use `.data()` and then `reinterpret_cast`.

## Note
This example looks very similar to existing test case third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webcodecs/audio_data.cc.
