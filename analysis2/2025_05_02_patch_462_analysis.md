# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_462

## First error
../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/fonts/shaping/shape_cache.h:69:7: error: no matching function for call to object of type 'const __copy'
   69 |       std::ranges::copy(characters, characters_);
      |       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter failed to handle cast of single variable span.

## Reason
The rewriter changed the member variable `characters_` from a C-style array to a `std::array`. This change exposed a problem where `std::ranges::copy` attempts to copy from a `base::span` to a `std::array` directly. The compiler complains that it couldn't copy `characters` (which became a span after the spanification), to a `std::array`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to insert an explicit span conversion.
The code needs to be rewritten as follows:
```
std::ranges::copy(base::span(characters, length_), characters_);
```

## Note
The secondary error is related to pointer arithmetic not working on `std::array` and should be solved by using `.data()` as shown below.
```
-      return UNSAFE_BUFFERS(characters_ + length_);
+      return UNSAFE_BUFFERS(characters_.data() + length_);
