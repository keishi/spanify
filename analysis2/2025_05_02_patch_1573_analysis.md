# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1573

## First error

../../ui/events/ozone/evdev/event_converter_evdev_impl.cc:116:22: error: member reference base type 'input_event[4]' is not a structure or union
  116 |       read(fd, inputs.data(),
      |                ~~~~~~^~~~~

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The code declares `input_event inputs[4];`, which is a C-style array. The rewriter didn't convert it to `std::array<input_event, 4>`, but it added `.data()` to it in the `read` function call. Since it is still a C-style array, calling `.data()` on it is invalid, resulting in a compile error.

## Solution
The rewriter should have converted `input_event inputs[4]` to `std::array<input_event, 4> inputs;`.
Alternatively, the rewriter should not have added the `.data()` call.
The rewriter must have logic to decide whether it should rewrite to std::array or span. Currently it is rewriting the function signature to accept a span and then rewriting the usage to use `.data()` but not rewriting the declaration of the array.

## Note
The rewriter is also adding `inputs.size()` to get the size of the array, but since the array was not arrayified, it also emits a similar error.
