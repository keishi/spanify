# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_498

## First error
../../mojo/public/cpp/bindings/tests/validation_test_input_parser.cc:136:66: error: 'DataType' is a private member of 'mojo::test::(anonymous namespace)::ValidationTestInputParser'
  136 | const auto kDataTypes = std::to_array<ValidationTestInputParser::DataType>(

## Category
Rewriter does not handle assignment of spanified variable from std::begin/end.

## Reason
The rewriter changed the declaration of `kDataTypes` to use `std::to_array`. However, `DataType` is a private member of the `ValidationTestInputParser` class. Since the `std::to_array` is outside the class definition, it does not have access to the `DataType` private member.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid spanifying `kDataTypes` since it results in a compilation error due to the `DataType` private member.

## Note
The subsequent errors are a direct result of the first error, as the code attempts to access the private `DataType` and private member functions (`ParseUnsignedInteger`, `ParseSignedInteger`, etc.) of the `ValidationTestInputParser` class from outside the class.
