# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_605

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/transforms/affine_transform.h:78:26: error: no viable conversion from 'const double[6]' to 'base::span<const double, 4>'

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The rewriter changed the function signature of `LoadDouble4` to take a `base::span<const double, 4>`. However, the code in `AffineTransform::IsApproximatelyIdentity` is passing `transform_` which is a `const double[6]`. The rewriter did not update the call sites to construct a span from this array.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to construct a span from the `transform_` array when calling `LoadDouble4`. This can be done by wrapping the array in a `base::span` constructor: `gfx::LoadDouble4(base::span<const double, 4>(transform_))`. The rewriter should automatically handle this conversion, or at least flag this usage as unsafe.

## Note
There are multiple similar errors in `affine_transform.h`. The fix should address all of these call sites.
