## First error

../../chrome/browser/prefs/chrome_command_line_pref_store_proxy_unittest.cc:67:14: error: suggest braces around initialization of subobject [-Werror,-Wmissing-braces]
   67 |             {switches::kNoProxyServer, nullptr},
      |              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      |              {                                }

## Category
Rewriter needs to nullptr initialization of spanified member field to {}.

## Reason
The rewriter changed `SwitchValue switches[2];` to `std::array<SwitchValue, 2> switches;`, but it did not update the initialization of `switches` to use brace initialization for the struct `SwitchValue`. The compiler is now suggesting to use braces around the initialization of the `SwitchValue` object inside the `std::array`.

## Solution
The rewriter should replace
```c++
{switches::kNoProxyServer, nullptr}
```
with
```c++
{{switches::kNoProxyServer, nullptr}}
```
The rewriter should recognize this pattern and add the extra braces for aggregate initialization of `std::array`s of structs/classes.

## Note
The other errors are follow-up errors of this missing braces.
