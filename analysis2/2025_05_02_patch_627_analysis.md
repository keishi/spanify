# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_627

## First error

```
../../media/formats/mp4/box_reader_unittest.cc:397:20: error: member reference base type 'const uint8_t[24]' (aka 'const unsigned char[24]') is not a structure or union
  397 |       kData, (kData.size() * sizeof(decltype(kData)::value_type)),
      |               ~~~~~^~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter added .data() to a variable/member it did not spanify/arrayify.

## Reason
The rewriter changed the function signature of `TestParsing32bitOverflow` to accept a `base::span<const uint8_t>`. However, at the call sites of this function, it incorrectly attempted to use `.size()` on the original C-style array `kData`. C-style arrays do not have a `.size()` method. The rewriter should not have modified the `sizeof` expression, since that is the correct way to get the size of the array.

## Solution
Remove the `.size()` and `sizeof(decltype(kData)::value_type)` from the `sizeof` expression on the call sites. The correct way to pass the size of the array `kData` to the `TestParsing32bitOverflow` is using `sizeof(kData)`.

## Note
The diff also includes an unnecessary `.data()` call in the buffer wrapper insertion. This should also be reverted.

```diff
 buffer_wrapper.insert(buffer_wrapper.end(), buffer.data(),
-                          buffer.subspan(size).data());
+                          buffer.subspan(0,size).data());
