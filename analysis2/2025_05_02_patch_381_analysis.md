# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_381

## First error

../../base/trace_event/trace_arguments_unittest.cc:292:7: error: reinterpret_cast from 'const std::string_view' (aka 'const basic_string_view<char>') to 'unsigned long long' is not allowed

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The code attempts to `reinterpret_cast` a `std::string_view` to an `unsigned long long`. The rewriter converted `kText` from `char[]` to `std::string_view`. Then it failed to remove `reinterpret_cast` when that variable is passed to `reinterpret_cast`. This cast is invalid and results in a compile error.

## Solution
The rewriter should remove the `reinterpret_cast` when `kText` is passed to `reinterpret_cast`. Since this code passes a pointer as an integer, this is likely unsafe anyway. It may be better to just not rewrite this line.

## Note
The second error is
```
../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

This seems to indicate that the rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value. However the first error is the primary cause.
