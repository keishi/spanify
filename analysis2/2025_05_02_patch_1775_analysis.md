## First error

../../mojo/core/ipcz_driver/driver.cc:317:5: error: cannot initialize a member subobject of type 'IpczResult (*)(IpczDriverHandle, IpczDriverHandle, uint32_t, const void *, volatile void *, size_t *, IpczDriverHandle *, size_t *)' (aka 'int (*)(unsigned long, unsigned long, unsigned int, const void *, volatile void *, unsigned long *, unsigned long *, unsigned long *)') with an lvalue of type 'IpczResult (IpczDriverHandle, IpczDriverHandle, uint32_t, const void *, volatile void *, size_t *, base::span<IpczDriverHandle>, size_t *)' (aka 'int (unsigned long, unsigned long, unsigned int, const void *, volatile void *, unsigned long *, span<unsigned long>, unsigned long *)'): type mismatch at 7th parameter ('IpczDriverHandle *' (aka 'unsigned long *') vs 'base::span<IpczDriverHandle>' (aka 'span<unsigned long>'))

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The error indicates a type mismatch when initializing a function pointer. The function pointer expects a raw pointer `IpczDriverHandle*` as the 7th parameter, but it's being initialized with a function that takes `base::span<IpczDriverHandle>` instead. This means the function `Serialize` in `driver.cc` is used to initialize a function pointer that requires the 7th parameter to be `IpczDriverHandle*`, but the rewriter did not update the signature of the function it is pointing to, and now it expects `base::span<IpczDriverHandle>`. The rewriter changed the definition of `Serialize` to take `base::span` but did not update the function pointer's signature.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to also update the function pointer signature in `driver.cc` where `Serialize` is being used. The rewriter needs to find all usages of the function being spanified to properly updated all call sites.

## Note
This patch also has an error in transport_test.cc. The SerializeObject call is being passed {} as the handles parameter which is now a span. This should be message.handles.
