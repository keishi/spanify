## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `subspan` method requires an unsigned integer, but the rewriter isn't generating the correct cast. The error message shows that the compiler is trying to implicitly cast from `int` to `unsigned long` (aka `size_t` in this case) using `strict_cast`, but there is no viable conversion.

## Solution
The rewriter should cast the argument to `subspan` to an unsigned value like `size_t`. This can be done by wrapping the argument with `base::checked_cast<size_t>()`.

## Note
