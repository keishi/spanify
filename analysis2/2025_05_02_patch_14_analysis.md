## First error

../../base/containers/span_forward_internal.h:20:49: error: 'InternalPtrType' declared as a pointer to a reference of type 'CSSSelector &'
   20 |           typename InternalPtrType = ElementType*>

## Category
Rewriter generated code with an invalid span type.

## Reason
The code attempts to create a span of `CSSSelector&`, which is a reference. `base::span` requires the `ElementType` to be an object type, not a reference type. The generated span type `base::span<CSSSelector&, 1>` is therefore invalid C++.

## Solution
The rewriter should not create spans of reference types. The rewriter should create a span of `CSSSelector` instead.

```diff
-  for (base::span<CSSSelector> s = base::span<CSSSelector&, 1>(&selector, 1u);;
+  for (base::span<CSSSelector> s = base::span<CSSSelector, 1>(&selector, 1u);;
```

## Note
The subsequent errors stem from the invalid span type.
