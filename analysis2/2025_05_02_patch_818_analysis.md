## First error

../../media/parsers/vp8_parser.cc:366:18: error: suggest braces around initialization of subobject [-Werror,-Wmissing-braces]
  366 |                 {255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255},

## Category
Rewriter needs to generate code to construct a span from the return value of a third_party function.

## Reason
The rewriter changed the `kCoeffUpdateProbs` from a C-style array to `std::array`. The initialization of the array elements now requires additional braces to be properly initialized. The compiler error "suggest braces around initialization of subobject" indicates that the nested structure of the array initialization is not being correctly handled with the new `std::array` type.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to be updated to handle the nested initialization of `std::array` correctly, adding the missing braces. The correct initialization syntax should be:

```c++
const std::array<
    std::array<std::array<std::array<const uint8_t, kNumEntropyNodes>,
                          kNumPrevCoeffContexts>,
               kNumCoeffBands>,
    kNumBlockTypes>
    kCoeffUpdateProbs = {{{
        {
            {{255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255}},
            {{255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255}},
            {{255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255}},
        },
```
The rewriter needs to insert braces around the initialization of each innermost array.

## Note
The compiler also emits "excess elements in struct initializer" errors, which are a consequence of the missing braces. Adding the braces as described above should resolve both errors.
