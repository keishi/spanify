# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_379

## First error

../../testing/libfuzzer/proto/skia_image_filter_proto_converter.cc:1114:30: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('const uint8_t *' (aka 'const unsigned char *') and 'base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>'))

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using pointer arithmetic with spanified variable.

## Reason
The code attempts to perform pointer arithmetic (`stop - src`) where `src` is now a `base::span`.  `stop` is assigned to `src.subspan(srcSize).data()` which returns `const uint8_t *`. The expression `stop - src` is therefore subtracting a `base::span` from a `const uint8_t*`, which is not a valid operation.

## Solution
Instead of using pointer arithmetic, use `srcSize` to determine the loop condition, and calculate the subspan using `src.subspan(offset)`. Change the loop declaration as follows:

```c++
  for (size_t offset = 0; offset < srcSize; ) {
```

Then, inside the loop replace `stop - src` with `srcSize - offset`.

## Note
Additional errors occurred because the rewriter did not properly handle incrementing and comparing `base::span` variables, and also failed to add a cast for `subspan`.
