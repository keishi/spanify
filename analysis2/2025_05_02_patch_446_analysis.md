# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_446

## First error

```
../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/scheduler/main_thread/main_thread_metrics_helper.cc:66:12: error: no viable conversion from 'const char[51]' to 'blink::CustomCountHistogram'
   66 |           {QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_INIT("Control")},
      |            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to nullptr initialization of spanified member field to {}.

## Reason
The original code used a C-style array with an initializer list to initialize the `queueing_delay_histograms_` member. The rewriter changed it to `std::array`, but the initializer list used with the macro `QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_INIT` is incompatible with the `std::array`'s constructor. `QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_INIT` expands to multiple arguments that are used to call a constructor of `CustomCountHistogram`. When the code was using C-style array, the braces around `QUEUEING_DELAY_HISTOGRAM_INIT` was working like a default initializer. With the `std::array`, the compiler is trying to convert "Control", an int, and another int into `blink::CustomCountHistogram`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to generate `{}` initialization for `std::array` member fields. Replace the initializer list in the original code with `{}`.
The correct initialization would be `std::array<CustomCountHistogram, static_cast<size_t>(TaskPriority::kPriorityCount)> queueing_delay_histograms_{};`

## Note
There are other errors after the first one due to the same reason.
