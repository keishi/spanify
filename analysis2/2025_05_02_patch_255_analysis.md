## First error

../../media/gpu/vaapi/av1_vaapi_video_encoder_delegate.cc:242:17: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('base::span<const uint8_t>' (aka 'span<const unsigned char>') invalid)
  242 |       DCHECK_LT(*src_seg_map, num_segments);
      |                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter has changed `src_seg_map` from `const uint8_t*` to `base::span<const uint8_t>`. However, the code still uses the indirection operator `*` on `src_seg_map`, which is no longer a pointer. The compiler error "indirection requires pointer operand" indicates that the indirection operator `*` cannot be applied to a `base::span`. The rewriter should have recognized this pattern and replaced `*src_seg_map` with `src_seg_map[0]`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to replace `*src_seg_map` with `src_seg_map[0]` when `src_seg_map` has been spanified.

```c++
// Before
DCHECK_LT(*src_seg_map, num_segments);

// After
DCHECK_LT(src_seg_map[0], num_segments);
```

## Note
The other errors are consequences of the first error.
