# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_572

## First error

../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/heap/test/heap_test.cc:2175:61: error: no matching member function for call to 'find'
 2175 |   HeapHashMap<void*, Member<IntVector>>::iterator it = map->find(key);
      |                                                        ~~~~~^~~~
../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/wtf/hash_map.h:171:12: note: candidate function not viable: no known conversion from 'base::span<int>' to 'void *const' for 1st argument; take the address of the argument with &
  171 |   iterator find(KeyPeekInType);
      |            ^    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The `HeapHashMap` in WTF uses `void*` as the key type. After spanifying `key`, it's no longer a `void*`, but a `base::span<int>`. The `find` and `at` methods of `HeapHashMap` expect a `void*` key, but they are receiving a `base::span<int>` instead. The error message "no known conversion from 'base::span<int>' to 'void *const' for 1st argument; take the address of the argument with &" suggests that the code is attempting to pass the span directly as a pointer, but the HashMap expects a pointer to the underlying data, not the span object itself.

## Solution
The spanified variable `key` is being used as a key in a `HeapHashMap`, which expects a `void*`. To resolve this, the rewriter must use `&k` instead of `key`.
The code before:
```c++
int k;
base::span<int> key = base::span<int, 1>(&k, 1u);
```

should be changed to:
```c++
int k;
int* key = &k;
```
to make it work.
And the code after:
```c++
 map->insert(key.subspan(1 + i), MakeGarbageCollected<IntVector>());
 map2->insert(key.subspan(1 + i), MakeGarbageCollected<IntDeque>());
```

should be changed to:

```c++
 map->insert(key + 1 + i, MakeGarbageCollected<IntVector>());
 map2->insert(key + 1 + i, MakeGarbageCollected<IntDeque>());
```

so that `map` and `map2` will have `void*` as key.

The rewriter has spanified a function parameter at the declaration, but failed to spanify the call site.

## Note
The rewriter also failed to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.
