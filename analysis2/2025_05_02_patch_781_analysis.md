# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_781

## First error
../../base/files/file_path.h:180:60: error: expected ';' at end of declaration list
  180 |   static constexpr std::array<CharType, 2> kSeparators{"/"});
      |                                                            ^
      |                                                            ;

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter introduced `#include <array>` in `base/files/file_path.h` and replaced the `kSeparators` declaration with a `std::array`. However, the `#endif` guard for `BASE_FILES_FILE_PATH_H_` was moved before `#include <array>` causing subsequent includes like `<cstddef>` to be included inside the `FilePath` class declaration, which is invalid C++ syntax because system headers may contain `extern "C" {}` which is not allowed inside a class definition.

## Solution
The rewriter should ensure that the `#include` directives are inserted outside of any class definitions, and that the header guard is not broken. The correct order should be:

```c++
#ifndef BASE_FILES_FILE_PATH_H_
#define BASE_FILES_FILE_PATH_H_

#include <array>
#include <cstddef>
...

class FilePath {
...
};

#endif  // BASE_FILES_FILE_PATH_H_
```

## Note
The second error `#endif without #if` is a direct consequence of the first error.
