## First error

../../base/pickle.h:340:24: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'char *' to function return type 'base::span<char>'

## Category
Rewriter failed to add `.data()` to a spanified return value.

## Reason
The rewriter converted the return type of `mutable_payload()` to `base::span<char>`, but it didn't update the return statement to return a `base::span<char>`. The `UNSAFE_TODO` macro expands to the original `char*` return value, causing a type mismatch.

## Solution
The rewriter should add `.data()` to the return value. The corrected code should be:

```c++
  base::span<char> mutable_payload() {
    return UNSAFE_TODO(reinterpret_cast<char*>(header_) + header_size_);
  }
```

should be changed to:

```c++
  base::span<char> mutable_payload() {
    return base::span<char>(UNSAFE_TODO(reinterpret_cast<char*>(header_) + header_size_), payload_size());
  }
```
A better approach would be to return `base::span<char>(payload(), payload_size())` directly. Note that `payload_size()` is another member of the class.
