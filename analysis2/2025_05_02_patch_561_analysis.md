# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_561

## First error

../../chrome/browser/extensions/api/declarative_content/declarative_content_apitest.cc:180:63: error: expected '}'
  180 |   ExtensionTestMessageListener ready_incognito("ready (split)");
      |                                                               ^
../../chrome/browser/extensions/api/declarative_content/declarative_content_apitest.cc:88:53: note: to match this '{'

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Reason
The error indicates an unmatched '{' brace within the `kBackgroundHelpers` array initialization. The change converted the `kBackgroundHelpers` variable from a `char[]` to `std::array<char, 1765>`. However, the string literal assigned to it contains a closing curly brace '}' which is interpreted as the end of the array initializer. The error `expected '}'` indicates the compiler is looking for the closing curly brace of a block or structure. The root cause is that there are unmatched curly braces within the string literal being assigned to the `std::array`. The code being assigned to `kBackgroundHelpers` is Javascript code that contains unbalanced curly braces. Since Javascript code is not C++ code, it should not be touched by the rewriter. The code is not part of third_party/, so the rewriter needs to avoid spanifying functions if it requires spanifying excluded code.

## Solution
The rewriter should not attempt to convert `kBackgroundHelpers` to `std::array` because the variable contains javascript code that is not managed by the rewriter. Rewriting this variable causes unbalanced curly braces in the file and leads to compilation errors.

## Note
The build log shows a cascade of errors after the initial brace mismatch, which are likely consequences of the broken syntax.
