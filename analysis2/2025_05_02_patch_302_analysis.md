## First error

../../base/containers/span.h:945:33: error: cannot form a reference to 'void'
  945 |   using reference = element_type&;
      |                                 ^

## Category
Rewriter failing to recognize raw pointer passed to spanified function.

## Reason
The `AlignedAlloc` function was spanified, but the return type `base::span<void>` is invalid since `base::span` requires a non-void element type. This resulted in a compilation error when trying to use `base::span<void>`. In `base/memory/aligned_memory.h`, `UNSAFE_BUFFERS` attempts to create a `HeapArray<char, AlignedFreeDeleter>` from the spanified return of `AlignedAlloc`, which expects a `char*` but receives `base::span<void>`.

## Solution
The rewriter should not spanify `AlignedAlloc` to return `base::span<void>`. Instead, it should return `void*` or `char*` directly, since the function allocates untyped memory. If spanification is desired, it should be done with a specific element type, not `void`. For example:

```c++
// Instead of:
base::span<void> AlignedAlloc(size_t size, size_t alignment);

// Use:
void* AlignedAlloc(size_t size, size_t alignment);

// OR

base::span<char> AlignedAlloc(size_t size, size_t alignment); // If char is the expected type.
```
The rewriter should also handle the case where the return value of `AlignedAlloc` is used in `UNSAFE_BUFFERS` macro to create a HeapArray. In these cases, spanification is not possible.

## Note
The error occurs in `base/memory/aligned_memory.h` due to attempting to create a `span<void>`, which is an invalid type. This happened because the rewriter spanified the function `AlignedAlloc` and failed to consider downstream usages like the `UNSAFE_BUFFERS` macro.
