# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1067

## First error

../../chrome/browser/apps/icon_standardizer.cc:118:9: error: reinterpret_cast from 'base::span<uint32_t>' (aka 'span<unsigned int>') to 'SkColor *' (aka 'unsigned int *') is not allowed
  118 |         reinterpret_cast<SkColor*>(UNSAFE_SKBITMAP_GETADDR32(preview, 0, y));
      |         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to avoid using reinterpret_cast on spanified variable.

## Reason
The rewriter has introduced a `base::span<SkColor>` via the `UNSAFE_SKBITMAP_GETADDR32` macro, but the code still contains a `reinterpret_cast` attempting to convert this span to an `SkColor*`.  `reinterpret_cast` is not allowed on spans. The underlying issue is that the rewriter spanified a variable but failed to remove a `reinterpret_cast` that was applied to it.

## Solution
The rewriter must be modified to identify and remove `reinterpret_cast` operations applied to variables that have been converted to spans.  In this specific case, the `preview_color` variable is now a span, so the `reinterpret_cast` is invalid. One possible solution is to use `preview_color.data()` to get a pointer from the span if the original code required a pointer. The rewriter needs to replace the `reinterpret_cast<SkColor*>(UNSAFE_SKBITMAP_GETADDR32(preview, 0, y))` with simply `UNSAFE_SKBITMAP_GETADDR32(preview, 0, y).data()`.

## Note
The error message clearly indicates that the `reinterpret_cast` is the cause of the problem. The rewriter should have either avoided spanifying the variable in this context or removed the problematic cast.
