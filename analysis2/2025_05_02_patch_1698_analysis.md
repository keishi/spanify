## First error

../../base/containers/span.h:16:10: fatal error: 'algorithm' file not found

## Category
Rewriter is including system headers inside a C++ class declaration, leading to syntax errors.

## Reason
The rewriter added `#include "base/containers/span.h"` to `suid_unsafe_environment_variables.h`. However, this header transitively includes system headers like `<algorithm>`. Because `sandbox.c` is a C file, the include of `<algorithm>` is causing a compile error.

## Solution
The rewriter should avoid adding `#include "base/containers/span.h"` in C files because it will include C++ headers.

## Note
None
