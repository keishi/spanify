## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The `base::span::subspan()` method requires an unsigned integer as an argument, but the code generated by the rewriter doesn't explicitly cast the value `1` to an unsigned type.  The `strict_cast` error arises because `base::span::subspan` requires arguments to be explicitly cast to `size_t` due to safe conversion checks.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to wrap the argument to `subspan()` with `base::checked_cast<size_t>()` and include the appropriate header.

```c++
base::span<const GLuint>(tx_ids).subspan(base::checked_cast<size_t>(1)).data()
```

```c++
#include "base/numerics/safe_conversions.h"
```
## Note
None
