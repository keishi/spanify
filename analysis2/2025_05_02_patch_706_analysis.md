# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_706

## First error

```
../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/fonts/shaping/glyph_offset_array.h:54:7: error: no matching function for call to object of type 'const __copy'
   54 |       std::ranges::copy(other1.storage_, GetStorage());
      |       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Rewriter needs to preserve constness when spanifying a member.

## Reason
The rewriter converted `GlyphOffset* GetStorage()` to `base::span<GlyphOffset> GetStorage()`.

However, `std::ranges::copy` requires the types to match. The first argument `other1.storage_` is `const HeapVector<GlyphOffset>&`, so `range.Offsets()` returns `base::span<const GlyphOffset>`, but the second argument `GetStorage()` returns `base::span<GlyphOffset>`.

The second error is related:
```
../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/fonts/shaping/glyph_offset_array.h:58:67: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('base::span<GlyphOffset>' (aka 'span<gfx::Vector2dF>') and 'wtf_size_t' (aka 'unsigned int'))
   58 |       std::ranges::copy(other2.storage_, UNSAFE_TODO(GetStorage() + size1));
```

`UNSAFE_TODO(GetStorage() + size1)` is performing pointer arithmetic on the returned `base::span<GlyphOffset>`, which is not allowed. `base::span` doesn't overload the + operator. This is because `GetStorage()` is not const, thus the rewriter believes it returns a pointer.

The rewriter should preserve constness when spanifying a member so that `GetStorage()` returns `base::span<const GlyphOffset>`.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to preserve constness when spanifying a member.

## Note
The type of `GlyphOffset` is `gfx::Vector2dF`, which is causing confusion with the error messages.
