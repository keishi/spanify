# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_552

## First error

```
../../ui/events/ozone/evdev/touch_filter/palm_model/onedevice_train_palm_detection_filter_inference_beta.cc:3919:3: error: no matching function for call to 'FullyConnected'
 3919 |   FullyConnected<float>(
      |   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The rewriter spanified the `FullyConnected` function's `input_values` parameter, changing it from `const T*` to `base::span<const T>`. However, the call site at line 3919 passes a raw pointer (`const float*`) as the `input_values` argument. The compiler cannot implicitly convert a raw pointer to a `base::span`. The rewriter only spanified the function signature and did not update the call sites to create a span from the raw pointer.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to identify all call sites of spanified functions and update them to construct `base::span` objects when passing raw pointers to spanified parameters. In this specific case, the rewriter should wrap the `input_values` argument in the call to `FullyConnected` at line 3919 with `base::span<const float>(...)` along with the size.

## Note
The diff provided only shows the function definition being changed. Need more context to determine the argument passed to `input_values` to determine the size of the span. The rewriter should generate the correct span from this pointer based on the available size information.
