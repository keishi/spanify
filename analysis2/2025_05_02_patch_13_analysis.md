# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_13

## First error

../../base/containers/span_forward_internal.h:20:49: error: 'InternalPtrType' declared as a pointer to a reference of type 'CSSSelector &'
   20 |           typename InternalPtrType = ElementType*>

## Category
Rewriter failed to handle cast of single variable span.

## Reason
The rewriter is attempting to create a `base::span` from a reference to a `CSSSelector` object, which is causing a type mismatch. `base::span` is designed to work with pointers to objects or arrays of objects, not references. The generated code `base::span<CSSSelector&, 1>(&selector, 1u)` is not valid since `base::span` does not take references.

## Solution
The rewriter added conversion for single variable span, but not its cast. The fix will be:

```diff
-  for (base::span<CSSSelector> s = base::span<CSSSelector&, 1>(&selector, 1u);;
+  for (base::span<CSSSelector, 1> s = base::span<CSSSelector, 1>(&selector, 1u);;
