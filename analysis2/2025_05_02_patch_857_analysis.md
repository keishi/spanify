## First error

../../services/on_device_model/fake/fake_chrome_ml_api.cc:471:35: error: cannot initialize a member subobject of type 'ChromeMLSafetyResult (*)(ChromeMLTSModel, const char *, float *, size_t *)' (aka 'ChromeMLSafetyResult (*)(unsigned long, const char *, float *, unsigned long *)') with an rvalue of type 'ChromeMLSafetyResult (*)(ChromeMLTSModel, const char *, base::span<float>, size_t *)' (aka 'ChromeMLSafetyResult (*)(unsigned long, const char *, span<float>, unsigned long *)'): type mismatch at 3rd parameter ('float *' vs 'base::span<float>')

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The function `TSModelClassifyTextSafety` was spanified to accept `base::span<float> scores` but the function pointer `.ClassifyTextSafety` expects `float* scores`. This means that the rewriter spanified a function, but failed to spanify a call site where the function pointer is used.

## Solution
The rewriter needs to find all call sites for spanified functions and ensure they are also updated to use spans. The function pointer `.ClassifyTextSafety` is an alias for the old signature. It should also be updated when `TSModelClassifyTextSafety` is spanified.
