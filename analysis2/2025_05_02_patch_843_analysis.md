## First error

../../gpu/command_buffer/client/cmd_buffer_helper_test.cc:95:15: error: no matching constructor for initialization of 'AsyncAPIMock::IsArgs'

## Category
Pointer passed into spanified function parameter.

## Reason
The `AddCommandWithExpect` function was spanified, but the call site in `TestCommandProcessing` is still passing a raw pointer. Specifically, the `IsArgs` method in `AsyncAPIMock` expects a `const volatile void*`, but it is receiving a `base::span<CommandBufferEntry>`.

## Solution
The call sites for `AddCommandWithExpect` need to be updated to pass a `base::span<CommandBufferEntry>`. There are two call sites that need to be modified:

1.  **TestCommandProcessing**: The call sites pass `nullptr` when there are no args. Convert these to empty spans `{}`.
2.  **TestCommandProcessing**: The call sites that have `CommandBufferEntry args1[2]` should pass a span over this array.

```c++
AddCommandWithExpect(error::kNoError, kUnusedCommandId, 0, {});

std::array<CommandBufferEntry, 2> args1;
args1[0].value_uint32 = 3;
args1[1].value_uint32 = 4;
AddCommandWithExpect(error::kNoError, kUnusedCommandId + 1, 2, base::span<CommandBufferEntry, 2>(args1));
```

## Note

The test `TestCommandWrappingExactMultiple` uses `CommandBufferEntry args1[kNumArgs];`. This should be converted to `std::array<CommandBufferEntry, kNumArgs> args1;` so that base::span can be constructed from it.
