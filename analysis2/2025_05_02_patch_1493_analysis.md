# Build Failure Analysis: 2025_05_02_patch_1493

## First error

../../base/numerics/safe_conversions.h:271:47: error: no matching function for call to 'strict_cast'
  271 |   constexpr StrictNumeric(Src value) : value_(strict_cast<T>(value)) {}
      |                                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Category
Rewriter needs to cast argument to base::span::subspan() to an unsigned value.

## Reason
The rewriter added `.subspan(sample_index)` but `sample_index` is a signed integer. The `subspan()` function requires an unsigned integer (size_t).  The `strict_cast` in safe_conversions.h failed because it can't convert a potentially negative number into an unsigned one.

## Solution
When adding `.subspan(expr)`, the rewriter should cast the expression to an unsigned type like `size_t` using `base::checked_cast<size_t>(expr)`. This requires adding an include for `base/numerics/safe_conversions.h`.
